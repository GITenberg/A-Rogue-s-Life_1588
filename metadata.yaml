description: The critical reader may possibly notice a tone of almost boisterous gayety
  in certain parts of these imaginary Confessions. I can only plead, in defense, that
  the story offers the faithful reflection of a very happy time in my past life. It
  was written at Paris, when I had Charles Dickens for a near neighbor and a daily
  companion, and when my leisure hours were joyously passed with many other friends,
  all associated with literature and art, of whom the admirable comedian, Regnier,
  is now the only survivor. The revising of these pages has been to me a melancholy
  task. I can only hop.
