    <h2>
      INTRODUCTORY WORDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following pages were written more than twenty years since, and were
      then published periodically in <i>Household Words.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the original form of publication the Rogue was very favorably received.
      Year after year, I delayed the republication, proposing, at the suggestion
      of my old friend, Mr. Charles Reade, to enlarge the present sketch of the
      hero&rsquo;s adventures in Australia. But the opportunity of carrying out this
      project has proved to be one of the lost opportunities of my life. I
      republish the story with its original conclusion unaltered, but with such
      occasional additions and improvements as will, I hope, render it more
      worthy of attention at the present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The critical reader may possibly notice a tone of almost boisterous gayety
      in certain parts of these imaginary Confessions. I can only plead, in
      defense, that the story offers the faithful reflection of a very happy
      time in my past life. It was written at Paris, when I had Charles Dickens
      for a near neighbor and a daily companion, and when my leisure hours were
      joyously passed with many other friends, all associated with literature
      and art, of whom the admirable comedian, Regnier, is now the only
      survivor. The revising of these pages has been to me a melancholy task. I
      can only hope that they may cheer the sad moments of others. The Rogue may
      surely claim two merits, at least, in the eyes of the new generation&mdash;he
      is never serious for two moments together; and he &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t take long to
      read.&rdquo; W. C.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I AM going to try if I can&rsquo;t write something about myself. My life has
      been rather a strange one. It may not seem particularly useful or
      respectable; but it has been, in some respects, adventurous; and that may
      give it claims to be read, even in the most prejudiced circles. I am an
      example of some of the workings of the social system of this illustrious
      country on the individual native, during the early part of the present
      century; and, if I may say so without unbecoming vanity, I should like to
      quote myself for the edification of my countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who am I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am remarkably well connected, I can tell you. I came into this world
      with the great advantage of having Lady Malkinshaw for a grandmother, her
      ladyship&rsquo;s daughter for a mother, and Francis James Softly, Esq., M. D.
      (commonly called Doctor Softly), for a father. I put my father last,
      because he was not so well connected as my mother, and my grandmother
      first, because she was the most nobly-born person of the three. I have
      been, am still, and may continue to be, a Rogue; but I hope I am not
      abandoned enough yet to forget the respect that is due to rank. On this
      account, I trust, nobody will show such want of regard for my feelings as
      to expect me to say much about my mother&rsquo;s brother. That inhuman person
      committed an outrage on his family by making a fortune in the soap and
      candle trade. I apologize for mentioning him, even in an accidental way.
      The fact is, he left my sister, Annabella, a legacy of rather a peculiar
      kind, saddled with certain conditions which indirectly affected me; but
      this passage of family history need not be produced just yet. I apologize
      a second time for alluding to money matters before it was absolutely
      necessary. Let me get back to a pleasing and reputable subject, by saying
      a word or two more about my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am rather afraid that Doctor Softly was not a clever medical man; for in
      spite of his great connections, he did not get a very magnificent practice
      as a physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general practitioner, he might have bought a comfortable business,
      with a house and snug surgery-shop attached; but the son-in-law of Lady
      Malkinshaw was obliged to hold up his head, and set up his carriage, and
      live in a street near a fashionable square, and keep an expensive and
      clumsy footman to answer the door, instead of a cheap and tidy housemaid.
      How he managed to &ldquo;maintain his position&rdquo; (that is the right phrase, I
      think), I never could tell. His wife did not bring him a farthing. When
      the honorable and gallant baronet, her father, died, he left the widowed
      Lady Malkinshaw with her worldly affairs in a curiously involved state.
      Her son (of whom I feel truly ashamed to be obliged to speak again so
      soon) made an effort to extricate his mother&mdash;involved himself in a
      series of pecuniary disasters, which commercial people call, I believe,
      transactions&mdash;struggled for a little while to get out of them in the
      character of an independent gentleman&mdash;failed&mdash;and then
      spiritlessly availed himself of the oleaginous refuge of the soap and
      candle trade. His mother always looked down upon him after this; but
      borrowed money of him also&mdash;in order to show, I suppose, that her
      maternal interest in her son was not quite extinct. My father tried to
      follow her example&mdash;in his wife&rsquo;s interests, of course; but the
      soap-boiler brutally buttoned up his pockets, and told my father to go
      into business for himself. Thus it happened that we were certainly a poor
      family, in spite of the fine appearance we made, the fashionable street we
      lived in, the neat brougham we kept, and the clumsy and expensive footman
      who answered our door.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done with me in the way of education?
    </p>
    <p>
      If my father had consulted his means, I should have been sent to a cheap
      commercial academy; but he had to consult his relationship to Lady
      Malkinshaw; so I was sent to one of the most fashionable and famous of the
      great public schools. I will not mention it by name, because I don&rsquo;t think
      the masters would be proud of my connection with it. I ran away three
      times, and was flogged three times. I made four aristocratic connections,
      and had four pitched battles with them: three thrashed me, and one I
      thrashed. I learned to play at cricket, to hate rich people, to cure
      warts, to write Latin verses, to swim, to recite speeches, to cook kidneys
      on toast, to draw caricatures of the masters, to construe Greek plays, to
      black boots, and to receive kicks and serious advice resignedly. Who will
      say that the fashionable public school was of no use to me after that?
    </p>
    <p>
      After I left school, I had the narrowest escape possible of intruding
      myself into another place of accommodation for distinguished people; in
      other words, I was very nearly being sent to college. Fortunately for me,
      my father lost a lawsuit just in the nick of time, and was obliged to
      scrape together every farthing of available money that he possessed to pay
      for the luxury of going to law. If he could have saved his seven
      shillings, he would certainly have sent me to scramble for a place in the
      pit of the great university theater; but his purse was empty, and his son
      was not eligible therefore for admission, in a gentlemanly capacity, at
      the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing was to choose a profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the Doctor was liberality itself, in leaving me to my own devices. I
      was of a roving adventurous temperament, and I should have liked to go
      into the army. But where was the money to come from, to pay for my
      commission? As to enlisting in the ranks, and working my way up, the
      social institutions of my country obliged the grandson of Lady Malkinshaw
      to begin military life as an officer and gentleman, or not to begin it at
      all. The army, therefore, was out of the question. The Church? Equally out
      of the question: since I could not pay for admission to the prepared place
      of accommodation for distinguished people, and could not accept a
      charitable free pass, in consequence of my high connections. The Bar? I
      should be five years getting to it, and should have to spend two hundred a
      year in going circuit before I had earned a farthing. Physic? This really
      seemed the only gentlemanly refuge left; and yet, with the knowledge of my
      father&rsquo;s experience before me, I was ungrateful enough to feel a secret
      dislike for it. It is a degrading confession to make; but I remember
      wishing I was not so highly connected, and absolutely thinking that the
      life of a commercial traveler would have suited me exactly, if I had not
      been a poor gentleman. Driving about from place to place, living jovially
      at inns, seeing fresh faces constantly, and getting money by all this
      enjoyment, instead of spending it&mdash;what a life for me, if I had been
      the son of a haberdasher and the grandson of a groom&rsquo;s widow!
    </p>
    <p>
      While my father was uncertain what to do with me, a new profession was
      suggested by a friend, which I shall repent not having been allowed to
      adopt, to the last day of my life. This friend was an eccentric old
      gentleman of large property, much respected in our family. One day, my
      father, in my presence, asked his advice about the best manner of starting
      me in life, with due credit to my connections and sufficient advantage to
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to my experience,&rdquo; said our eccentric friend, &ldquo;and, if you are a
      wise man, you will make up your mind as soon as you have heard me. I have
      three sons. I brought my eldest son up to the Church; he is said to be
      getting on admirably, and he costs me three hundred a year. I brought my
      second son up to the Bar; he is said to be getting on admirably, and he
      costs me four hundred a year. I brought my third son up to <i>Quadrilles</i>&mdash;he
      has married an heiress, and he costs me nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, me! if that worthy sage&rsquo;s advice had only been followed&mdash;if I had
      been brought up to Quadrilles!&mdash;if I had only been cast loose on the
      ballrooms of London, to qualify under Hymen, for a golden degree! Oh! you
      young ladies with money, I was five feet ten in my stockings; I was great
      at small-talk and dancing; I had glossy whiskers, curling locks, and a
      rich voice! Ye girls with golden guineas, ye nymphs with crisp bank-notes,
      mourn over the husband you have lost among you&mdash;over the Rogue who
      has broken the laws which, as the partner of a landed or fund-holding
      woman, he might have helped to make on the benches of the British
      Parliament! Oh! ye hearths and homes sung about in so many songs&mdash;written
      about in so many books&mdash;shouted about in so many speeches, with
      accompaniment of so much loud cheering: what a settler on the hearth-rug;
      what a possessor of property; what a bringer-up of a family, was snatched
      away from you, when the son of Dr. Softly was lost to the profession of
      Quadrilles!
    </p>
    <p>
      It ended in my resigning myself to the misfortune of being a doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I was a very good boy and took pains, and carefully mixed in the best
      society, I might hope in the course of years to succeed to my father&rsquo;s
      brougham, fashionably-situated house, and clumsy and expensive footman.
      There was a prospect for a lad of spirit, with the blood of the early
      Malkinshaws (who were Rogues of great capacity and distinction in the
      feudal times) coursing adventurous through every vein! I look back on my
      career, and when I remember the patience with which I accepted a medical
      destiny, I appear to myself in the light of a hero. Nay, I even went
      beyond the passive virtue of accepting my destiny&mdash;I actually
      studied, I made the acquaintance of the skeleton, I was on friendly terms
      with the muscular system, and the mysteries of Physiology dropped in on me
      in the kindest manner whenever they had an evening to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this was not the worst of it. I disliked the abstruse studies of my
      new profession; but I absolutely hated the diurnal slavery of qualifying
      myself, in a social point of view, for future success in it. My fond
      medical parent insisted on introducing me to his whole connection. I went
      round visiting in the neat brougham&mdash;with a stethoscope and medical
      review in the front-pocket, with Doctor Softly by my side, keeping his
      face well in view at the window&mdash;to canvass for patients, in the
      character of my father&rsquo;s hopeful successor. Never have I been so ill at
      ease in prison, as I was in that carriage. I have felt more at home in the
      dock (such is the natural depravity and perversity of my disposition) than
      ever I felt in the drawing-rooms of my father&rsquo;s distinguished patrons and
      respectable friends. Nor did my miseries end with the morning calls. I was
      commanded to attend all dinner-parties, and to make myself agreeable at
      all balls. The dinners were the worst trial. Sometimes, indeed, we
      contrived to get ourselves asked to the houses of high and mighty
      entertainers, where we ate the finest French dishes and drank the oldest
      vintages, and fortified ourselves sensibly and snugly in that way against
      the frigidity of the company. Of these repasts I have no hard words to
      say; it is of the dinners we gave ourselves, and of the dinners which
      people in our rank of life gave to us, that I now bitterly complain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever observed the remarkable adherence to set forms of speech
      which characterizes the talkers of arrant nonsense! Precisely the same
      sheepish following of one given example distinguishes the ordering of
      genteel dinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we gave a dinner at home, we had gravy soup, turbot and
      lobster-sauce, haunch of mutton, boiled fowls and tongue, lukewarm
      oyster-patties and sticky curry for side-dishes; wild duck,
      cabinet-pudding, jelly, cream and tartlets. All excellent things, except
      when you have to eat them continually. We lived upon them entirely in the
      season. Every one of our hospitable friends gave us a return dinner, which
      was a perfect copy of ours&mdash;just as ours was a perfect copy of
      theirs, last year. They boiled what we boiled, and we roasted what they
      roasted. We none of us ever changed the succession of the courses&mdash;or
      made more or less of them&mdash;or altered the position of the fowls
      opposite the mistress and the haunch opposite the master. My stomach used
      to quail within me, in those times, when the tureen was taken off and the
      inevitable gravy-soup smell renewed its daily acquaintance with my
      nostrils, and warned me of the persistent eatable formalities that were
      certain to follow. I suppose that honest people, who have known what it is
      to get no dinner (being a Rogue, I have myself never wanted for one), have
      gone through some very acute suffering under that privation. It may be
      some consolation to them to know that, next to absolute starvation, the
      same company-dinner, every day, is one of the hardest trials that assail
      human endurance. I date my first serious determination to throw over the
      medical profession at the earliest convenient opportunity, from the second
      season&rsquo;s series of dinners at which my aspirations, as a rising physician,
      unavoidably and regularly condemned me to be present.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE opportunity I wanted presented itself in a curious way, and led,
      unexpectedly enough, to some rather important consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already stated, among the other branches of human attainment which
      I acquired at the public school, that I learned to draw caricatures of the
      masters who were so obliging as to educate me. I had a natural faculty for
      this useful department of art. I improved it greatly by practice in secret
      after I left school, and I ended by making it a source of profit and
      pocket money to me when I entered the medical profession. What was I to
      do? I could not expect for years to make a halfpenny, as a physician. My
      genteel walk in life led me away from all immediate sources of emolument,
      and my father could only afford to give me an allowance which was too
      preposterously small to be mentioned. I had helped myself surreptitiously
      to pocket-money at school, by selling my caricatures, and I was obliged to
      repeat the process at home!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of which I write, the Art of Caricature was just approaching
      the close of its colored and most extravagant stage of development. The
      subtlety and truth to Nature required for the pursuit of it now, had
      hardly begun to be thought of then. Sheer farce and coarse burlesque, with
      plenty of color for the money, still made up the sum of what the public of
      those days wanted. I was first assured of my capacity for the production
      of these requisites, by a medical friend of the ripe critical age of
      nineteen. He knew a print-publisher, and enthusiastically showed him a
      portfolio full of my sketches, taking care at my request not to mention my
      name. Rather to my surprise (for I was too conceited to be greatly amazed
      by the circumstance), the publisher picked out a few of the best of my
      wares, and boldly bought them of me&mdash;of course, at his own price.
      From that time I became, in an anonymous way, one of the young buccaneers
      of British Caricature; cruising about here, there and everywhere, at all
      my intervals of spare time, for any prize in the shape of a subject which
      it was possible to pick up. Little did my highly-connected mother think
      that, among the colored prints in the shop-window, which disrespectfully
      illustrated the public and private proceedings of distinguished
      individuals, certain specimens bearing the classic signature of &ldquo;Thersites
      Junior,&rdquo; were produced from designs furnished by her studious and medical
      son. Little did my respectable father imagine when, with great difficulty
      and vexation, he succeeded in getting me now and then smuggled, along with
      himself, inside the pale of fashionable society&mdash;that he was helping
      me to study likenesses which were destined under my reckless treatment to
      make the public laugh at some of his most august patrons, and to fill the
      pockets of his son with professional fees, never once dreamed of in his
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than a year I managed, unsuspected, to keep the Privy Purse
      fairly supplied by the exercise of my caricaturing abilities. But the day
      of detection was to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether my medical friend&rsquo;s admiration of my satirical sketches led him
      into talking about them in public with too little reserve; or whether the
      servants at home found private means of watching me in my moments of
      Art-study, I know not: but that some one betrayed me, and that the
      discovery of my illicit manufacture of caricatures was actually
      communicated even to the grandmotherly head and fount of the family honor,
      is a most certain and lamentable matter of fact. One morning my father
      received a letter from Lady Malkinshaw herself, informing him, in a
      handwriting crooked with poignant grief, and blotted at every third word
      by the violence of virtuous indignation, that &ldquo;Thersites Junior&rdquo; was his
      own son, and that, in one of the last of the &ldquo;ribald&rsquo;s&rdquo; caricatures her
      own venerable features were unmistakably represented as belonging to the
      body of a large owl!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I laid my hand on my heart and indignantly denied everything.
      Useless. My original model for the owl had got proofs of my guilt that
      were not to be resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, ordinarily the most mellifluous and self-possessed of men,
      flew into a violent, roaring, cursing passion, on this occasion&mdash;declared
      that I was imperiling the honor and standing of the family&mdash;insisted
      on my never drawing another caricature, either for public or private
      purposes, as long as I lived; and ordered me to go forthwith and ask
      pardon of Lady Malkinshaw in the humblest terms that it was possible to
      select. I answered dutifully that I was quite ready to obey, on the
      condition that he should reimburse me by a trebled allowance for what I
      should lose by giving up the Art of Caricature, or that Lady Malkinshaw
      should confer on me the appointment of physician-in-waiting on her, with a
      handsome salary attached. These extremely moderate stipulations so
      increased my father&rsquo;s anger, that he asserted, with an unmentionably
      vulgar oath, his resolution to turn me out of doors if I did not do as he
      bid me, without daring to hint at any conditions whatsoever. I bowed, and
      said that I would save him the exertion of turning me out of doors, by
      going of my own accord. He shook his fist at me; after which it obviously
      became my duty, as a member of a gentlemanly and peaceful profession, to
      leave the room. The same evening I left the house, and I have never once
      given the clumsy and expensive footman the trouble of answering the door
      to me since that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have reason to believe that my exodus from home was, on the whole,
      favorably viewed by my mother, as tending to remove any possibility of my
      bad character and conduct interfering with my sister&rsquo;s advancement in
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of angling with great dexterity and patience, under the direction
      of both her parents, my handsome sister Annabella had succeeded in
      catching an eligible husband, in the shape of a wizen, miserly,
      mahogany-colored man, turned fifty, who had made a fortune in the West
      Indies. His name was Batterbury; he had been dried up under a tropical
      sun, so as to look as if he would keep for ages; he had two subjects of
      conversation, the yellow-fever and the advantage of walking exercise: and
      he was barbarian enough to take a violent dislike to me. He had proved a
      very delicate fish to hook; and, even when Annabella had caught him, my
      father and mother had great difficulty in landing him&mdash;principally,
      they were good enough to say, in consequence of my presence on the scene.
      Hence the decided advantage of my removal from home. It is a very pleasant
      reflection to me, now, to remember how disinterestedly I studied the good
      of my family in those early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abandoned entirely to my own resources, I naturally returned to the
      business of caricaturing with renewed ardor.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Thersites Junior really began to make something like a
      reputation, and to walk abroad habitually with a bank-note comfortably
      lodged among the other papers in his pocketbook. For a year I lived a gay
      and glorious life in some of the freest society in London; at the end of
      that time, my tradesmen, without any provocation on my part, sent in their
      bills. I found myself in the very absurd position of having no money to
      pay them, and told them all so with the frankness which is one of the best
      sides of my character. They received my advances toward a better
      understanding with brutal incivility, and treated me soon afterward with a
      want of confidence which I may forgive, but can never forget. One day, a
      dirty stranger touched me on the shoulder, and showed me a dirty slip of
      paper which I at first presumed to be his card. Before I could tell him
      what a vulgar document it looked like, two more dirty strangers put me
      into a hackney coach. Before I could prove to them that this proceeding
      was a gross infringement on the liberties of the British subject, I found
      myself lodged within the walls of a prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! and what of that? Who am I that I should object to being in prison,
      when so many of the royal personages and illustrious characters of history
      have been there before me? Can I not carry on my vocation in greater
      comfort here than I could in my father&rsquo;s house? Have I any anxieties
      outside these walls? No: for my beloved sister is married&mdash;the family
      net has landed Mr. Batterbury at last. No: for I read in the paper the
      other day, that Doctor Softly (doubtless through the interest of Lady
      Malkinshaw) has been appointed the
      King&rsquo;s-Barber-Surgeon&rsquo;s-Deputy-Consulting Physician. My relatives are
      comfortable in their sphere&mdash;let me proceed forthwith to make myself
      comfortable in mine. Pen, ink, and paper, if you please, Mr. Jailer: I
      wish to write to my esteemed publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR&mdash;Please advertise a series of twelve Racy Prints, from my
      fertile pencil, entitled, &lsquo;Scenes of Modern Prison Life,&rsquo; by Thersites
      Junior. The two first designs will be ready by the end of the week, to be
      paid for on delivery, according to the terms settled between us for my
      previous publications of the same size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With great regard and esteem, faithfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FRANK SOFTLY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having thus provided for my support in prison, I was enabled to introduce
      myself to my fellow-debtors, and to study character for the new series of
      prints, on the very first day of my incarceration, with my mind quite at
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the reader desires to make acquaintance with the associates of my
      captivity, I must refer him to &ldquo;Scenes of Modern Prison Life,&rdquo; by
      Thersites Junior, now doubtless extremely scarce, but producible to the
      demands of patience and perseverance, I should imagine, if anybody will be
      so obliging as to pass a week or so over the catalogue of the British
      Museum. My fertile pencil has delineated the characters I met with, at
      that period of my life, with a force and distinctness which my pen cannot
      hope to rival&mdash;has portrayed them all more or less prominently, with
      the one solitary exception of a prisoner called Gentleman Jones. The
      reasons why I excluded him from my portrait-gallery are so honorable to
      both of us, that I must ask permission briefly to record them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My fellow-captives soon discovered that I was studying their personal
      peculiarities for my own advantage and for the public amusement. Some
      thought the thing a good joke; some objected to it, and quarreled with me.
      Liberality in the matter of liquor and small loans, reconciled a large
      proportion of the objectors to their fate; the sulky minority I treated
      with contempt, and scourged avengingly with the smart lash of caricature.
      I was at that time probably the most impudent man of my age in all
      England, and the common flock of jail-birds quailed before the
      magnificence of my assurance. One prisoner only set me and my pencil
      successfully at defiance. That prisoner was Gentleman Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had received his name from the suavity of his countenance, the
      inveterate politeness of his language, and the unassailable composure of
      his manner. He was in the prime of life, but very bald&mdash;had been in
      the army and the coal trade&mdash;wore very stiff collars and prodigiously
      long wristbands&mdash;seldom laughed, but talked with remarkable glibness,
      and was never known to lose his temper under the most aggravating
      circumstances of prison existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He abstained from interfering with me and my studies, until it was
      reported in our society, that in the sixth print of my series, Gentleman
      Jones, highly caricatured, was to form one of the principal figures. He
      then appealed to me personally and publicly, on the racket-ground, in the
      following terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, with his usual politeness and his unwavering smile, &ldquo;you
      will greatly oblige me by not caricaturing my personal peculiarities. I am
      so unfortunate as not to possess a sense of humor; and if you did my
      likeness, I am afraid I should not see the joke of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I returned, with my customary impudence, &ldquo;it is not of the
      slightest importance whether <i>you</i> see the joke of it or not. The
      public will&mdash;and that is enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that civil speech, I turned on my heel; and the prisoners near all
      burst out laughing. Gentleman Jones, not in the least altered or ruffled,
      smoothed down his wristbands, smiled, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening I was in my room alone, designing the new print, when
      there came a knock at the door, and Gentleman Jones walked in. I got up,
      and asked what the devil he wanted. He smiled, and turned up his long
      wristbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to give you a lesson in politeness,&rdquo; said Gentleman Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, sir? How dare you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was a smart slap on the face. I instantly struck out in a state
      of fury&mdash;was stopped with great neatness&mdash;and received in return
      a blow on the head, which sent me down on the carpet half stunned, and too
      giddy to know the difference between the floor and the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Gentleman Jones, smoothing down his wristbands again, and
      addressing me blandly as I lay on the floor, &ldquo;I have the honor to inform
      you that you have now received your first lesson in politeness. Always be
      civil to those who are civil to you. The little matter of the caricature
      we will settle on a future occasion. I wish you good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise of my fall had been heard by the other occupants of rooms on my
      landing. Most fortunately for my dignity, they did not come in to see what
      was the matter until I had been able to get into my chair again. When they
      entered, I felt that the impression of the slap was red on my face still,
      but the mark of the blow was hidden by my hair. Under these fortunate
      circumstances, I was able to keep up my character among my friends, when
      they inquired about the scuffle, by informing them that Gentleman Jones
      had audaciously slapped my face, and that I had been obliged to retaliate
      by knocking him down. My word in the prison was as good as his; and if my
      version of the story got fairly the start of his, I had the better chance
      of the two of being believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was rather anxious, the next day, to know what course my polite and
      pugilistic instructor would take. To my utter amazement, he bowed to me as
      civilly as usual when we met in the yard; he never denied my version of
      the story; and when my friends laughed at him as a thrashed man, he took
      not the slightest notice of their agreeable merriment. Antiquity, I think,
      furnishes us with few more remarkable characters than Gentleman Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening I thought it desirable to invite a friend to pass the time
      with me. As long as my liquor lasted he stopped; when it was gone, he went
      away. I was just locking the door after him, when it was pushed open
      gently, but very firmly, and Gentleman Jones walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      My pride, which had not allowed me to apply for protection to the prison
      authorities, would not allow me now to call for help. I tried to get to
      the fireplace and arm myself with the poker, but Gentleman Jones was too
      quick for me. &ldquo;I have come, sir, to give you a lesson in morality
      to-night,&rdquo; he said; and up went his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped the preliminary slap, but before I could hit him, his terrible
      left fist reached my head again; and down I fell once more&mdash;upon the
      hearth-rug this time&mdash;not over-heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Gentleman Jones, making me a bow, &ldquo;you have now received your
      first lesson in morality. Always speak the truth; and never say what is
      false of another man behind his back. To-morrow, with your kind
      permission, we will finally settle the adjourned question of the
      caricature. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was far too sensible a man to leave the settling of that question to
      him. The first thing in the morning I sent a polite note to Gentleman
      Jones, informing him that I had abandoned all idea of exhibiting his
      likeness to the public in my series of prints, and giving him full
      permission to inspect every design I made before it went out of the
      prison. I received a most civil answer, thanking me for my courtesy, and
      complimenting me on the extraordinary aptitude with which I profited by
      the most incomplete and elementary instruction. I thought I deserved the
      compliment, and I think so still. Our conduct, as I have already
      intimated, was honorable to us, on either side. It was honorable attention
      on the part of Gentleman Jones to correct me when I was in error; it was
      honorable common sense in me to profit by the correction. I have never
      seen this great man since he compounded with his creditors and got out of
      prison; but my feelings toward him are still those of profound gratitude
      and respect. He gave me the only useful teaching I ever had; and if this
      should meet the eye of Gentleman Jones I hereby thank him for beginning
      and ending my education in two evenings, without costing me or my family a
      single farthing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To return to my business affairs. When I was comfortably settled in the
      prison, and knew exactly what I owed, I thought it my duty to my father to
      give him the first chance of getting me out. His answer to my letter
      contained a quotation from Shakespeare on the subject of thankless
      children, but no remittance of money. After that, my only course was to
      employ a lawyer and be declared a bankrupt. I was most uncivilly treated,
      and remanded two or three times. When everything I possessed had been sold
      for the benefit of my creditors, I was reprimanded and let out. It is
      pleasant to think that, even then, my faith in myself and in human nature
      was still not shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten days before my liberation, I was thunderstruck at receiving a
      visit from my sister&rsquo;s mahogany-colored husband, Mr. Batterbury. When I
      was respectably settled at home, this gentleman would not so much as look
      at me without a frown; and now, when I was a scamp, in prison, he
      mercifully and fraternally came to condole with me on my misfortunes. A
      little dexterous questioning disclosed the secret of this prodigious
      change in our relations toward each other, and informed me of a family
      event which altered my position toward my sister in the most whimsical
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was being removed to the bankruptcy court, my uncle in the soap
      and candle trade was being removed to the other world. His will took no
      notice of my father or my mother; but he left to my sister (always
      supposed to be his favorite in the family) a most extraordinary legacy of
      possible pin-money, in the shape of a contingent reversion to the sum of
      three thousand pounds, payable on the death of Lady Malkinshaw, provided I
      survived her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this document sprang into existence out of any of his involved
      money transactions with his mother was more than Mr. Batterbury could
      tell. I could ascertain nothing in relation to it, except that the bequest
      was accompanied by some cynical remarks, to the effect that the testator
      would feel happy if his legacy were instrumental in reviving the dormant
      interest of only one member of Doctor Softly&rsquo;s family in the fortunes of
      the hopeful young gentleman who had run away from home. My esteemed uncle
      evidently felt that he could not in common decency avoid doing something
      for his sister&rsquo;s family; and he had done it accordingly in the most
      malicious and mischievous manner. This was characteristic of him; he was
      just the man, if he had not possessed the document before, to have had it
      drawn out on his death-bed for the amiable purpose which it was now
      devoted to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a pretty complication! Here was my sister&rsquo;s handsome legacy made
      dependent on my outliving my grandmother! This was diverting enough; but
      Mr. Batterbury&rsquo;s conduct was more amusing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miserly little wretch not only tried to conceal his greedy desire to
      save his own pockets by securing the allowance of pin-money left to his
      wife, but absolutely persisted in ignoring the plain fact that his visit
      to me sprang from the serious pecuniary interest which he and Annabella
      now had in the life and health of your humble servant. I made all the
      necessary jokes about the strength of the vital principle in Lady
      Malkinshaw, and the broken condition of my own constitution; but he
      solemnly abstained from understanding one of them. He resolutely kept up
      appearances in the very face of detection; not the faintest shade of red
      came over his wicked old mahogany face as he told me how shocked he and
      his wife were at my present position, and how anxious Annabella was that
      he should not forget to give me her love. Tenderhearted creature! I had
      only been in prison six months when that overwhelming testimony of
      sisterly affection came to console me in my captivity. Ministering angel!
      you shall get your three thousand pounds. I am fifty years younger than
      Lady Malkinshaw, and I will take care of myself, Annabella, for thy dear
      sake!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time I saw Mr. Batterbury was on the day when I at last got my
      discharge. He was not waiting to see where I was going next, or what vital
      risks I was likely to run on the recovery of my freedom, but to
      congratulate me, and to give me Annabella&rsquo;s love. It was a very gratifying
      attention, and I said as much, in tones of the deepest feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is dear Lady Malkinshaw?&rdquo; I asked, when my grateful emotions had
      subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Batterbury shook his head mournfully. &ldquo;I regret to say, not quite so
      well as her friends could wish,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The last time I had the
      pleasure of seeing her ladyship, she looked so yellow that if we had been
      in Jamaica I should have said it was a case of death in twelve hours. I
      respectfully endeavored to impress upon her ladyship the necessity of
      keeping the functions of the liver active by daily walking exercise; time,
      distance, and pace being regulated with proper regard to her age&mdash;you
      understand me?&mdash;of course, with proper regard to her age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not possibly have given her better advice,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;When I saw
      her, as long as two years ago, Lady Malkinshaw&rsquo;s favorite delusion was
      that she was the most active woman of seventy-five in all England. She
      used to tumble downstairs two or three times a week, then, because she
      never would allow any one to help her; and could not be brought to believe
      that she was as blind as a mole, and as rickety on her legs as a child of
      a year old. Now you have encouraged her to take to walking, she will be
      more obstinate than ever, and is sure to tumble down daily, out of doors
      as well as in. Not even the celebrated Malkinshaw toughness can last out
      more than a few weeks of that practice. Considering the present shattered
      condition of my constitution, you couldn&rsquo;t have given her better advice&mdash;upon
      my word of honor, you couldn&rsquo;t have given her better advice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Mr. Batterbury, with a power of face I envied; &ldquo;I am
      afraid, my dear Frank (let me call you Frank), that I don&rsquo;t quite
      apprehend your meaning: and we have unfortunately no time to enter into
      explanations. Five miles here by a roundabout way is only half my daily
      allowance of walking exercise; five miles back by a roundabout way remain
      to be now accomplished. So glad to see you at liberty again! Mind you let
      us know where you settle, and take care of yourself; and do recognize the
      importance to the whole animal economy of daily walking exercise&mdash;do
      now! Did I give you Annabella&rsquo;s love? She&rsquo;s so well. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away went Mr. Batterbury to finish his walk for the sake of his health,
      and away went I to visit my publisher for the sake of my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unexpected disappointment awaited me. My &ldquo;Scenes of Modern Prison Life&rdquo;
       had not sold so well as had been anticipated, and my publisher was gruffly
      disinclined to speculate in any future works done in the same style.
      During the time of my imprisonment, a new caricaturist had started, with a
      manner of his own; he had already formed a new school, and the fickle
      public were all running together after him and his disciples. I said to
      myself: &ldquo;This scene in the drama of your life, my friend, has closed in;
      you must enter on another, or drop the curtain at once.&rdquo; Of course I
      entered on another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking leave of my publisher, I went to consult an artist-friend on my
      future prospects. I supposed myself to be merely on my way to a change of
      profession. As destiny ordered it, I was also on my way to the woman who
      was not only to be the object of my first love, but the innocent cause of
      the great disaster of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first saw her in one of the narrow streets leading from Leicester Square
      to the Strand. There was something in her face (dimly visible behind a
      thick veil) that instantly stopped me as I passed her. I looked back and
      hesitated. Her figure was the perfection of modest grace. I yielded to the
      impulse of the moment. In plain words, I did what you would have done, in
      my place&mdash;I followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round&mdash;discovered me&mdash;and instantly quickened her
      pace. Reaching the westward end of the Strand, she crossed the street and
      suddenly entered a shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked through the window, and saw her speak to a respectable elderly
      person behind the counter, who darted an indignant look at me, and at once
      led my charming stranger into a back office. For the moment, I was fool
      enough to feel puzzled; it was out of my character you will say&mdash;but
      remember, all men are fools when they first fall in love. After a little
      while I recovered the use of my senses. The shop was at the corner of a
      side street, leading to the market, since removed to make room for the
      railway. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a back entrance to the house!&rdquo; I thought to myself&mdash;and
      ran down the side street. Too late! the lovely fugitive had escaped me.
      Had I lost her forever in the great world of London? I thought so at the
      time. Events will show that I never was more mistaken in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in no humor to call on my friend. It was not until another day had
      passed that I sufficiently recovered my composure to see poverty staring
      me in the face, and to understand that I had really no alternative but to
      ask the good-natured artist to lend me a helping hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard it darkly whispered that he was something of a vagabond. But
      the term is so loosely applied, and it seems so difficult, after all, to
      define what a vagabond is, or to strike the right moral balance between
      the vagabond work which is boldly published, and the vagabond work which
      is reserved for private circulation only, that I did not feel justified in
      holding aloof from my former friend. Accordingly, I renewed our
      acquaintance, and told him my present difficulty. He was a sharp man, and
      he showed me a way out of it directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a good eye for a likeness,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you have made it keep
      you hitherto. Very well. Make it keep you still. You can&rsquo;t profitably
      caricature people&rsquo;s faces any longer&mdash;never mind! go to the other
      extreme, and flatter them now. Turn portrait-painter. You shall have the
      use of this study three days in the week, for ten shillings a week&mdash;sleeping
      on the hearth-rug included, if you like. Get your paints, rouse up your
      friends, set to work at once. Drawing is of no consequence; painting is of
      no consequence; perspective is of no consequence; ideas are of no
      consequence. Everything is of no consequence, except catching a likeness
      and flattering your sitter&mdash;and that you know you can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt that I could; and left him for the nearest colorman&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I got to the shop, I met Mr. Batterbury taking his walking
      exercise. He stopped, shook hands with me affectionately, and asked where
      I was going. A wonderful idea struck me. Instead of answering his
      question, I asked after Lady Malkinshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; said Mr. Batterbury; &ldquo;her ladyship tumbled downstairs
      yesterday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, allow me to congratulate you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most fortunately,&rdquo; continued Mr. Batterbury, with a strong emphasis on
      the words, and a fixed stare at me; &ldquo;most fortunately, the servant had
      been careless enough to leave a large bundle of clothes for the wash at
      the foot of the stairs, while she went to answer the door. Falling
      headlong from the landing, her ladyship pitched (pardon me the expression)&mdash;pitched
      into the very middle of the bundle. She was a little shaken at the time,
      but is reported to be going on charmingly this morning. Most fortunate,
      was it not? Seen the papers? Awful news from Demerara&mdash;the yellow
      fever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was at Demerara,&rdquo; I said, in a hollow voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Why?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Batterbury, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am homeless, friendless, penniless,&rdquo; I went on, getting more hollow at
      every word. &ldquo;All my intellectual instincts tell me that I could retrieve
      my position and live respectably in the world, if I might only try my hand
      at portrait-painting&mdash;the thing of all others that I am naturally
      fittest for. But I have nobody to start me; no sitter to give me a first
      chance; nothing in my pocket but three-and-sixpence; and nothing in my
      mind but a doubt whether I shall struggle on a little longer, or end it
      immediately in the Thames. Don&rsquo;t let me detain you from your walk, my dear
      sir. I&rsquo;m afraid Lady Malkinshaw will outlive me, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Mr. Batterbury; his mahogany face actually getting white
      with alarm. &ldquo;Stop! Don&rsquo;t talk in that dreadfully unprincipled manner&mdash;don&rsquo;t,
      I implore, I insist! You have plenty of friends&mdash;you have me, and
      your sister. Take to portrait-painting&mdash;think of your family, and
      take to portrait-painting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I to get a sitter?&rsquo; I inquired, with a gloomy shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said Mr. Batterbury, with an effort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be your first sitter. As
      a beginner, and especially to a member of the family, I suppose your terms
      will be moderate. Small beginnings&mdash;you know the proverb?&rdquo; Here he
      stopped; and a miserly leer puckered up his mahogany cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do you, life-size, down to your waistcoat, for fifty pounds,&rdquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Batterbury winced, and looked about him to the right and left, as if
      he wanted to run away. He had five thousand a year, but he contrived to
      took, at that moment, as if his utmost income was five hundred. I walked
      on a few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely those terms are rather high to begin with?&rdquo; he said, walking after
      me. &ldquo;I should have thought five-and-thirty, or perhaps forty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman, sir, cannot condescend to bargain,&rdquo; said I, with mournful
      dignity. &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; I waved my hand, and crossed over the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; cried Mr. Batterbury. &ldquo;I accept. Give me your address.
      I&rsquo;ll come tomorrow. Will it include the frame! There! there! it doesn&rsquo;t
      include the frame, of course. Where are you going now? To the colorman? He
      doesn&rsquo;t live in the Strand, I hope&mdash;or near one of the bridges. Think
      of Annabella, think of the family, think of the fifty pounds&mdash;an
      income, a year&rsquo;s income to a prudent man. Pray, pray be careful, and
      compose your mind: promise me, my dear, dear fellow&mdash;promise me, on
      your word of honor, to compose your mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left him still harping on that string, and suffering, I believe, the
      only serious attack of mental distress that had ever affected him in the
      whole course of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold me, then, now starting afresh in the world, in the character of a
      portrait-painter; with the payment of my remuneration from my first sitter
      depending whimsically on the life of my grandmother. If you care to know
      how Lady Malkinshaw&rsquo;s health got on, and how I succeeded in my new
      profession, you have only to follow the further course of these
      confessions, in the next chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I GAVE my orders to the colorman, and settled matters with my friend the
      artist that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, before the hour at which I expected my sitter, having
      just now as much interest in the life of Lady Malkinshaw as Mr. Batterbury
      had in her death, I went to make kind inquiries after her ladyship&rsquo;s
      health. The answer was most reassuring. Lady Malkinshaw had no present
      intention of permitting me to survive her. She was, at that very moment,
      meritoriously and heartily engaged in eating her breakfast. My prospects
      being now of the best possible kind, I felt encouraged to write once more
      to my father, telling him of my fresh start in life, and proposing a
      renewal of our acquaintance. I regret to say that he was so rude as not to
      answer my letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Batterbury was punctual to the moment. He gave a gasp of relief when
      he beheld me, full of life, with my palette on my thumb, gazing fondly on
      my new canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I like to see you with your mind composed.
      Annabella would have come with me; but she has a little headache this
      morning. She sends her love and best wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seized my chalks and began with that confidence in myself which has
      never forsaken me in any emergency. Being perfectly well aware of the
      absolute dependence of the art of portrait-painting on the art of
      flattery, I determined to start with making the mere outline of my
      likeness a compliment to my sitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was much easier to resolve on doing this than really to do it. In the
      first place, my hand would relapse into its wicked old caricaturing
      habits. In the second place, my brother-in-law&rsquo;s face was so inveterately
      and completely ugly as to set every artifice of pictorial improvement at
      flat defiance. When a man has a nose an inch long, with the nostrils set
      perpendicularly, it is impossible to flatter it&mdash;you must either
      change it into a fancy nose, or resignedly acquiesce in it. When a man has
      no perceptible eyelids, and when his eyes globularly project so far out of
      his head, that you expect to have to pick them up for him whenever you see
      him lean forward, how are mortal fingers and bushes to diffuse the right
      complimentary expression over them? You must either do them the most
      hideous and complete justice, or give them up altogether. The late Sir
      Thomas Lawrence, P.R.A., was undoubtedly the most artful and
      uncompromising flatterer that ever smoothed out all the natural
      characteristic blemishes from a sitter&rsquo;s face; but even that accomplished
      parasite would have found Mr. Batterbury too much for him, and would have
      been driven, for the first time in his practice of art, to the uncustomary
      and uncourtly resource of absolutely painting a genuine likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, I put my trust in Lady Malkinshaw&rsquo;s power of living, and
      portrayed the face of Mr. Batterbury in all its native horror. At the same
      time, I sensibly guarded against even the most improbable accidents, by
      making him pay me the fifty pounds as we went on, by installments. We had
      ten sittings. Each one of them began with a message from Mr. Batterbury,
      giving me Annabella&rsquo;s love and apologies for not being able to come and
      see me. Each one of them ended with an argument between Mr. Batterbury and
      me relative to the transfer of five pounds from his pocket to mine. I came
      off victorious on every occasion&mdash;being backed by the noble behavior
      of Lady Malkinshaw, who abstained from tumbling down, and who ate and
      drank, and slept and grew lusty, for three weeks together. Venerable
      woman! She put fifty pounds into my pocket. I shall think of her with
      gratitude and respect to the end of my days.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, while I was sitting before my completed portrait, inwardly
      shuddering over the ugliness of it, a suffocating smell of musk was wafted
      into the studio; it was followed by a sound of rustling garments; and that
      again was succeeded by the personal appearance of my affectionate sister,
      with her husband at her heels. Annabella had got to the end of her stock
      of apologies, and had come to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her handkerchief to her nose the moment she entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Frank? Don&rsquo;t kiss me: you smell of paint, and I can&rsquo;t bear
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt a similar antipathy to the smell of musk, and had not the slightest
      intention of kissing her; but I was too gallant a man to say so; and I
      only begged her to favor me by looking at her husband&rsquo;s portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabella glanced all round the room, with her handkerchief still at her
      nose, and gathered her magnificent silk dress close about her superb
      figure with her disengaged hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a horrid place!&rdquo; she said faintly behind her handkerchief. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
      you take some of the paint away? I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s oil on the floor. How am
      I to get past that nasty table with the palette on it? Why can&rsquo;t you bring
      the picture down to the carriage, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Advancing a few steps, and looking suspiciously about her while she spoke,
      her eyes fell on the chimney-piece. An eau-de-Cologne bottle stood upon
      it, which she took up immediately with a languishing sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contained turpentine for washing brushes in. Before I could warn her,
      she had sprinkled herself absently with half the contents of the bottle.
      In spite of all the musk that now filled the room, the turpentine betrayed
      itself almost as soon as I cried &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Annabella, with a shriek of
      disgust, flung the bottle furiously into the fireplace. Fortunately it was
      summer-time, or I might have had to echo the shriek with a cry of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wretch! you brute! you low, mischievous, swindling blackguard!&rdquo; cried
      my amiable sister, shaking her skirts with all her might, &ldquo;you have done
      this on purpose! Don&rsquo;t tell me! I know you have. What do you mean by
      pestering me to come to this dog-kennel of a place?&rdquo; she continued,
      turning fiercely upon the partner of her existence and legitimate
      receptacle of all her superfluous wrath. &ldquo;What do you mean by bringing me
      here, to see how you have been swindled? Yes, sir, swindled! He has no
      more idea of painting than you have. He has cheated you out of your money.
      If he was starving tomorrow he would be the last man in England to make
      away with himself&mdash;he is too great a wretch&mdash;he is too vicious&mdash;he
      is too lost to all sense of respectability&mdash;he is too much of a
      discredit to his family. Take me away! Give me your arm directly! I told
      you not to go near him from the first. This is what comes of your horrid
      fondness for money. Suppose Lady Malkinshaw does outlive him; suppose I do
      lose my legacy. What is three thousand pounds to you? My dress is ruined.
      My shawl&rsquo;s spoiled. <i>He</i> die! If the old woman lives to the age of
      Methuselah, he won&rsquo;t die. Give me your arm. No! Go to my father. I want
      medical advice. My nerves are torn to pieces. I&rsquo;m giddy, faint, sick&mdash;SICK,
      Mr. Batterbury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she became hysterical, and vanished, leaving a mixed odor of musk and
      turpentine behind her, which preserved the memory of her visit for nearly
      a week afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another scene in the drama of my life seems likely to close in before
      long,&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;No chance now of getting my amiable sister to patronize
      struggling genius. Do I know of anybody else who will sit to me? No, not a
      soul. Having thus no portraits of other people to paint, what is it my
      duty, as a neglected artist, to do next? Clearly to take a portrait of
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did so, making my own likeness quite a pleasant relief to the ugliness
      of my brother-in-law&rsquo;s. It was my intention to send both portraits to the
      Royal Academy Exhibition, to get custom, and show the public generally
      what I could do. I knew the institution with which I had to deal, and
      called my own likeness, Portrait of a Nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      That dexterous appeal to the tenderest feelings of my distinguished
      countrymen very nearly succeeded. The portrait of Mr. Batterbury (much the
      more carefully-painted picture of the two) was summarily turned out. The
      Portrait of a Nobleman was politely reserved to be hung up, if the Royal
      Academicians could possibly find room for it. They could not. So that
      picture also vanished back into the obscurity of the artist&rsquo;s easel. Weak
      and well-meaning people would have desponded under these circumstances;
      but your genuine Rogue is a man of elastic temperament, not easily
      compressible under any pressure of disaster. I sent the portrait of Mr.
      Batterbury to the house of that distinguished patron, and the Portrait of
      a Nobleman to the Pawnbroker&rsquo;s. After this I had plenty of elbow-room in
      the studio, and could walk up and down briskly, smoking my pipe, and
      thinking about what I should do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had observed that the generous friend and vagabond brother artist, whose
      lodger I now was, never seemed to be in absolute want of money; and yet
      the walls of his studio informed me that nobody bought his pictures. There
      hung all his great works, rejected by the Royal Academy, and neglected by
      the patrons of Art; and there, nevertheless, was he, blithely plying the
      brush; not rich, it is true, but certainly never without money enough in
      his pocket for the supply of all his modest wants. Where did he find his
      resources? I determined to ask him the question the very next time he came
      to the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; I said (we called each other by our Christian names), &ldquo;where do
      you get your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;what makes you ask that question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessity,&rdquo; I proceeded. &ldquo;My stock of money is decreasing, and I don&rsquo;t
      know how to replenish it. My pictures have been turned out of the
      exhibition-rooms; nobody comes to sit to me; I can&rsquo;t make a farthing; and
      I must try another line in the Arts, or leave your studio. We are old
      friends now. I&rsquo;ve paid you honestly week by week; and if you can oblige
      me, I think you ought. You earn money somehow. Why can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you at all particular?&rdquo; asked Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick nodded, and looked pleased; handed me my hat, and put on his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just the sort of man I like,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and I would sooner
      trust you than any one else I know. You ask how I contrive to earn money,
      seeing that all my pictures are still in my own possession. My dear
      fellow, whenever my pockets are empty, and I want a ten-pound note to put
      into them, I make an Old Master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared hard at him, not at first quite understanding what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Old Master I can make best,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;is Claude Lorraine,
      whom you may have heard of occasionally as a famous painter of classical
      landscapes. I don&rsquo;t exactly know (he has been dead so long) how many
      pictures he turned out, from first to last; but we will say, for the sake
      of argument, five hundred. Not five of these are offered for sale,
      perhaps, in the course of five years. Enlightened collectors of old
      pictures pour into the market by fifties, while genuine specimens of
      Claude, or of any other Old Master you like to mention, only dribble in by
      ones and twos. Under these circumstances, what is to be done? Are
      unoffending owners of galleries to be subjected to disappointment? Or are
      the works of Claude, and the other fellows, to be benevolently increased
      in number, to supply the wants of persons of taste and quality? No man of
      humanity but must lean to the latter alternative. The collectors, observe,
      don&rsquo;t know anything about it&mdash;they buy Claude (to take an instance
      from my own practice) as they buy all the other Old Masters, because of
      his reputation, not because of the pleasure they get from his works. Give
      them a picture with a good large ruin, fancy trees, prancing nymphs, and a
      watery sky; dirty it down dexterously to the right pitch; put it in an old
      frame; call it a Claude; and the sphere of the Old Master is enlarged, the
      collector is delighted, the picture-dealer is enriched, and the neglected
      modern artist claps a joyful hand on a well-filled pocket. Some men have a
      knack at making Rembrandts, others have a turn for Raphaels, Titians,
      Cuyps, Watteaus, and the rest of them. Anyhow, we are all made happy&mdash;all
      pleased with each other&mdash;all benefited alike. Kindness is propagated
      and money is dispersed. Come along, my boy, and make an Old Master!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HE led the way into the street as he spoke. I felt the irresistible force
      of his logic. I sympathized with the ardent philanthropy of his motives. I
      burned with a noble ambition to extend the sphere of the Old Masters. In
      short, I took the tide at the flood, and followed Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      We plunged into some by-streets, struck off sharp into a court, and
      entered a house by a back door. A little old gentleman in a black velvet
      dressing-gown met us in the passage. Dick instantly presented me: &ldquo;Mr.
      Frank Softly&mdash;Mr. Ishmael Pickup.&rdquo; The little old gentleman stared at
      me distrustfully. I bowed to him with that inexorable politeness which I
      first learned under the instructive fist of Gentleman Jones, and which no
      force of adverse circumstances has ever availed to mitigate in after life.
      Mr. Ishmael Pickup followed my lead. There is not the least need to
      describe him&mdash;he was a Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the front show-room, and look at the pictures, while I speak to
      Mr. Pickup,&rdquo; said Dick, familiarly throwing open a door, and pushing me
      into a kind of gallery beyond. I found myself quite alone, surrounded by
      modern-antique pictures of all schools and sizes, of all degrees of dirt
      and dullness, with all the names of all the famous Old Masters, from
      Titian to Teniers, inscribed on their frames. A &ldquo;pearly little gem,&rdquo; by
      Claude, with a ticket marked &ldquo;Sold&rdquo; stuck into the frame, particularly
      attracted my attention. It was Dick&rsquo;s last ten-pound job; and it did
      credit to the youthful master&rsquo;s abilities as a workman-like maker of
      Claudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been informed that, since the time of which I am writing, the
      business of gentlemen of Mr. Pickup&rsquo;s class has rather fallen off, and
      that there are dealers in pictures, nowadays, who are as just and
      honorable men as can be found in any profession or calling, anywhere under
      the sun. This change, which I report with sincerity and reflect on with
      amazement, is, as I suspect, mainly the result of certain wholesale modern
      improvements in the position of contemporary Art, which have necessitated
      improvements and alterations in the business of picture-dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my time, the encouragers of modern painting were limited in number to a
      few noblemen and gentlemen of ancient lineage, who, in matters of taste,
      at least, never presumed to think for themselves. They either inherited or
      bought a gallery more or less full of old pictures. It was as much a part
      of their education to put their faith in these on hearsay evidence, as to
      put their faith in King, Lords and Commons. It was an article of their
      creed to believe that the dead painters were the great men, and that the
      more the living painters imitated the dead, the better was their chance of
      becoming at some future day, and in a minor degree, great also. At certain
      times and seasons, these noblemen and gentlemen self-distrustfully strayed
      into the painting-room of a modern artist, self-distrustfully allowed
      themselves to be rather attracted by his pictures, self-distrustfully
      bought one or two of them at prices which would appear so incredibly low,
      in these days, that I really cannot venture to quote them. The picture was
      sent home; the nobleman or gentleman (almost always an amiable and a
      hospitable man) would ask the artist to his house and introduce him to the
      distinguished individuals who frequented it; but would never admit his
      picture, on terms of equality, into the society even of the second-rate
      Old Masters. His work was hung up in any out-of-the-way corner of the
      gallery that could be found; it had been bought under protest; it was
      admitted by sufferance; its freshness and brightness damaged it terribly
      by contrast with the dirtiness and the dinginess of its elderly
      predecessors; and its only points selected for praise were those in which
      it most nearly resembled the peculiar mannerism of some Old Master, not
      those in which it resembled the characteristics of the old mistress&mdash;Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate artist had no court of appeal that he could turn to.
      Nobody beneath the nobleman, or the gentleman of ancient lineage, so much
      as thought of buying a modern picture. Nobody dared to whisper that the
      Art of painting had in anywise been improved or worthily enlarged in its
      sphere by any modern professors. For one nobleman who was ready to buy one
      genuine modern picture at a small price, there were twenty noblemen ready
      to buy twenty more than doubtful old pictures at great prices. The
      consequence was, that some of the most famous artists of the English
      school, whose pictures are now bought at auction sales for fabulous sums,
      were then hardly able to make an income. They were a scrupulously patient
      and conscientious body of men, who would as soon have thought of breaking
      into a house, or equalizing the distribution of wealth, on the highway, by
      the simple machinery of a horse and pistol, as of making Old Masters to
      order. They sat resignedly in their lonely studios, surrounded by unsold
      pictures which have since been covered again and again with gold and
      bank-notes by eager buyers at auctions and show-rooms, whose money has
      gone into other than the painter&rsquo;s pockets&mdash;-who have never dreamed
      that the painter had the smallest moral right to a farthing of it. Year
      after year, these martyrs of the brush stood, palette in hand, fighting
      the old battle of individual merit against contemporary dullness&mdash;fighting
      bravely, patiently, independently; and leaving to Mr. Pickup and his
      pupils a complete monopoly of all the profit which could be extracted, in
      their line of business, from the feebly-buttoned pocket of the patron, and
      the inexhaustible credulity of the connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all this is changed. Traders and makers of all kinds of commodities
      have effected a revolution in the picture-world, never dreamed of by the
      noblemen and gentlemen of ancient lineage, and consistently protested
      against to this day by the very few of them who still remain alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daring innovators started with the new notion of buying a picture
      which they themselves could admire and appreciate, and for the genuineness
      of which the artist was still living to vouch. These rough and ready
      customers were not to be led by rules or frightened by precedents; they
      were not to be easily imposed upon, for the article they wanted was not to
      be easily counterfeited. Sturdily holding to their own opinions, they
      thought incessant repetitions of Saints, Martyrs, and Holy Families,
      monotonous and uninteresting&mdash;and said so. They thought little
      pictures of ugly Dutch women scouring pots, and drunken Dutchmen playing
      cards, dirty and dear at the price&mdash;and said so. They saw that trees
      were green in nature, and brown in the Old Masters, and they thought the
      latter color not an improvement on the former&mdash;and said so. They
      wanted interesting subjects; variety, resemblance to nature; genuineness
      of the article, and fresh paint; they had no ancestors whose feelings, as
      founders of galleries, it was necessary to consult; no critical gentlemen
      and writers of valuable works to snub them when they were in spirits;
      nothing to lead them by the nose but their own shrewdness, their own
      interests, and their own tastes&mdash;so they turned their backs valiantly
      on the Old Masters, and marched off in a body to the living men.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time good modern pictures have risen in the scale. Even as
      articles of commerce and safe investments for money, they have now (as
      some disinterested collectors who dine at certain annual dinners I know
      of, can testify) distanced the old pictures in the race. The modern
      painters who have survived the brunt of the battle, have lived to see
      pictures for which they once asked hundreds, selling for thousands, and
      the young generation making incomes by the brush in one year, which it
      would have cost the old heroes of the easel ten to accumulate. The
      posterity of Mr. Pickup still do a tolerable stroke of business (making
      bright modern masters for the market which is glutted with the dingy old
      material), and will, probably, continue to thrive and multiply in the
      future: the one venerable institution of this world which we can safely
      count upon as likely to last, being the institution of human folly.
      Nevertheless, if a wise man of the reformed taste wants a modern picture,
      there are places for him to go to now where he may be sure of getting it
      genuine; where, if the artist is not alive to vouch for his work, the
      facts at any rate have not had time to die which vouch for the dealer who
      sells it. In my time matters were rather different. The painters <i>we</i>
      throve by had died long enough ago for pedigrees to get confused, and
      identities disputable; and if I had been desirous of really purchasing a
      genuine Old Master for myself&mdash;speaking as a practical man&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know where I should have gone to ask for one, or whose judgment I
      could have safely relied on to guard me from being cheated, before I
      bought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are stopping a long time in the picture-gallery, you will say. I am
      very sorry&mdash;but we must stay a little longer, for the sake of a
      living picture, the gem of the collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still admiring Mr. Pickup&rsquo;s Old Masters, when a dirty little boy
      opened the door of the gallery, and introduced a young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart&mdash;fancy my having a heart!&mdash;gave one great bound in me.
      I recognized the charming person whom I had followed in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her veil was not down this time. All the beauty of her large, soft,
      melancholy, brown eyes beamed on me. Her delicate complexion became
      suddenly suffused with a lovely rosy flush. Her glorious black hair&mdash;no!
      I will make an effort, I will suppress my ecstasies. Let me only say that
      she evidently recognized me. Will you believe it?&mdash;I felt myself
      coloring as I bowed to her. I never blushed before in my life. What a very
      curious sensation it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      The horrid boy claimed her attention with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master&rsquo;s engaged,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Please to wait here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to disturb Mr. Pickup,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a voice! No! I am drifting back into ecstasies: her voice was worthy
      of her&mdash;I say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be so kind as to show him this,&rdquo; she proceeded; &ldquo;he knows
      what it is. And please say, my father is very ill and very anxious. It
      will be quite enough if Mr. Pickup will only send me word by you&mdash;Yes
      or No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave the boy an oblong slip of stamped paper. Evidently a promissory
      note. An angel on earth, sent by an inhuman father, to ask a Jew for
      discount! Monstrous!
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy disappeared with the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seized my opportunity of speaking to her. Don&rsquo;t ask me what I said!
      Never before (or since) have I talked such utter nonsense, with such
      intense earnestness of purpose and such immeasurable depth of feeling. Do
      pray remember what you said yourself, the first time you had the chance of
      opening your heart to <i>your</i> young lady. The boy returned before I
      had half done, and gave her back the odious document.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pickup&rsquo;s very sorry, miss. The answer is, No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lost all her lovely color, and sighed, and turned away. As she pulled
      down her veil, I saw the tears in her eyes. Did that piteous spectacle
      partially deprive me of my senses? I actually entreated her to let me be
      of some use&mdash;as if I had been an old friend, with money enough in my
      pocket to discount the note myself. She brought me back to my senses with
      the utmost gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you forget, sir, that we are strangers. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed her to the door. I asked leave to call on her father, and
      satisfy him about myself and my family connections. She only answered that
      her father was too ill to see visitors. I went out with her on to the
      landing. She turned on me sharply for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see for yourself, sir, that I am in great distress. I appeal to
      you, as a gentleman, to spare me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If you still doubt whether I was really in love, let the facts speak for
      themselves. I hung my head, and let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned alone to the picture-gallery&mdash;when I remembered that
      I had not even had the wit to improve my opportunity by discovering her
      name and address&mdash;I did really and seriously ask myself if these were
      the first symptoms of softening of the brain. I got up, and sat down
      again. I, the most audacious man of my age in London, had behaved like a
      bashful boy! Once more I had lost her&mdash;and this time, also, I had
      nobody but myself to blame for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These melancholy meditations were interrupted by the appearance of my
      friend, the artist, in the picture-gallery. He approached me
      confidentially, and spoke in a mysterious whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pickup is suspicious,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I have had all the difficulty in the
      world to pave your way smoothly for you at the outset. However, if you can
      contrive to make a small Rembrandt, as a specimen, you may consider
      yourself employed here until further notice. I am obliged to particularize
      Rembrandt, because he is the only Old Master disengaged at present. The
      professional gentleman who used to do him died the other day in the Fleet&mdash;he
      had a turn for Rembrandts, and can&rsquo;t be easily replaced. Do you think you
      could step into his shoes? It&rsquo;s a peculiar gift, like an ear for music, or
      a turn for mathematics. Of course you will be put up to the simple
      elementary rules, and will have the professional gentleman&rsquo;s last
      Rembrandt as a guide; the rest depends, my dear friend, on your powers of
      imitation. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged by failures, but try again and again; and
      mind you are dirty and dark enough. You have heard a great deal about the
      light and shade of Rembrandt&mdash;Remember always that, in your case,
      light means dusky yellow, and shade dense black; remember that, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No pay,&rdquo; said the voice of Mr. Pickup behind me; &ldquo;no pay, my dear, unlesh
      your Rembrandt ish good enough to take me in&mdash;even me, Ishmael, who
      dealsh in pictersh and knowsh what&rsquo;sh what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did I care about Rembrandt at that moment? I was thinking of my lost
      young lady; and I should probably have taken no notice of Mr. Pickup, if
      it had not occurred to me that the old wretch must know her father&rsquo;s name
      and address. I at once put the question. The Jew grinned, and shook his
      grisly head. &ldquo;Her father&rsquo;sh in difficultiesh, and mum&rsquo;s the word, my
      dear.&rdquo; To that answer he adhered, in spite of all that I could say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With equal obstinacy I determined, sooner or later, to get my information.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took service under Mr. Pickup, purposing to make myself essential to his
      prosperity, in a commercial sense&mdash;and then to threaten him with
      offering my services to a rival manufacturer of Old Masters, unless he
      trusted me with the secret of the name and address. My plan looked
      promising enough at the time. But, as some wise person has said, Man is
      the sport of circumstances. Mr. Pickup and I parted company unexpectedly,
      on compulsion. And, of all the people in the world, my grandmother, Lady
      Malkinshaw, was the unconscious first cause of the events which brought me
      and the beloved object together again, for the third time!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the next day, I was introduced to the Jew&rsquo;s workshop, and to the
      eminent gentlemen occupying it. My model Rembrandt was put before me; the
      simple elementary rules were explained; and my materials were all placed
      under my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regard for the lovers of the Old Masters, and for the moral well-being of
      society, forbids me to be particular about the nature of my labors, or to
      go into dangerous detail on the subject of my first failures and my
      subsequent success. I may, however, harmlessly admit that my Rembrandt was
      to be of the small or cabinet size, and that, as there was a run on
      Burgomasters just then, my subject was naturally to be of the Burgomaster
      sort. Three parts of my picture consisted entirely of different shades of
      dirty brown and black; the fourth being composed of a ray of yellow light
      falling upon the wrinkled face of a treacle-colored old man. A dim glimpse
      of a hand, and a faint suggestion of something like a brass washhand
      basin, completed the job, which gave great satisfaction to Mr. Pickup, and
      which was described in the catalogue as&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Burgomaster at Breakfast. Originally in the collection of Mynheer Van
      Grubb. Amsterdam. A rare example of the master. Not engraved. The
      chiar&rsquo;oscuro in this extraordinary work is of a truly sublime character.
      Price, Two Hundred Guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got five pounds for it. I suppose Mr. Pickup got one-ninety-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was perhaps not very encouraging as a beginning, in a pecuniary point
      of view. But I was to get five pounds more, if my Rembrandt sold within a
      given time. It sold a week after it was in a fit state to be trusted in
      the showroom. I got my money, and began enthusiastically on another
      Rembrandt&mdash;&ldquo;A Burgomaster&rsquo;s Wife Poking the Fire.&rdquo; Last time, the
      chiar&rsquo;oscuro of the master had been yellow and black, this time it was to
      be red and black. I was just on the point of forcing my way into Mr.
      Pickup&rsquo;s confidence, as I had resolved, when a catastrophe happened, which
      shut up the shop and abruptly terminated my experience as a maker of Old
      Masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Burgomaster&rsquo;s Breakfast&rdquo; had been sold to a new customer, a venerable
      connoisseur, blessed with a great fortune and a large picture-gallery. The
      old gentleman was in raptures with the picture&mdash;with its tone, with
      its breadth, with its grand feeling for effect, with its simple treatment
      of detail. It wanted nothing, in his opinion, but a little cleaning. Mr.
      Pickup knew the raw and ticklish state of the surface, however, far too
      well, to allow of even an attempt at performing this process, and solemnly
      asserted, that he was acquainted with no cleansing preparation which could
      be used on the Rembrandt without danger of &ldquo;flaying off the last exquisite
      glazings of the immortal master&rsquo;s brush.&rdquo; The old gentleman was quite
      satisfied with this reason for not cleaning the Burgomaster, and took away
      his purchase in his own carriage on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three weeks we heard nothing more of him. At the end of that time, a
      Hebrew friend of Mr. Pickup, employed in a lawyer&rsquo;s office, terrified us
      all by the information that a gentleman related to our venerable
      connoisseur had seen the Rembrandt, had pronounced it to be an impudent
      counterfeit, and had engaged on his own account to have the picture tested
      in a court of law, and to charge the seller and maker thereof with
      conspiring to obtain money under false pretenses. Mr. Pickup and I looked
      at each other with very blank faces on receiving this agreeable piece of
      news. What was to be done? I recovered the full use of my faculties first;
      and I was the man who solved that important and difficult question, while
      the rest were still utterly bewildered by it. &ldquo;Will you promise me five
      and twenty pounds in the presence of these gentlemen if I get you out of
      this scrape?&rdquo; said I to my terrified employer. Ishmael Pickup wrung his
      dirty hands and answered, &ldquo;Yesh, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our informant in this awkward matter was employed at the office of the
      lawyers who were to have the conducting of the case against us; and he was
      able to tell me some of the things I most wanted to know in relation to
      the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found out from him that the Rembrandt was still in our customer&rsquo;s
      possession. The old gentleman had consented to the question of its
      genuineness being tried, but had far too high an idea of his own knowledge
      as a connoisseur to incline to the opinion that he had been taken in. His
      suspicious relative was not staying in the house, but was in the habit of
      visiting him, every day, in the forenoon. That was as much as I wanted to
      know from others. The rest depended on myself, on luck, time, human
      credulity, and a smattering of chemical knowledge which I had acquired in
      the days of my medical studies. I left the conclave at the
      picture-dealer&rsquo;s forthwith, and purchased at the nearest druggist&rsquo;s a
      bottle containing a certain powerful liquid, which I decline to
      particularize on high moral grounds. I labeled the bottle &ldquo;The Amsterdam
      Cleansing Compound&rdquo;; and I wrapped round it the following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pickup&rsquo;s respectful compliments to Mr.&mdash;(let us say, Green). Is
      rejoiced to state that he finds himself unexpectedly able to forward Mr.
      Green&rsquo;s views relative to the cleaning of &lsquo;The Burgomaster&rsquo;s Breakfast.&rsquo; 
      The inclosed compound has just reached him from Amsterdam. It is made from
      a recipe found among the papers of Rembrandt himself&mdash;has been used
      with the most astonishing results on the Master&rsquo;s pictures in every
      gallery of Holland, and is now being applied to the surface of the largest
      Rembrandt in Mr. P.&lsquo;s own collection. Directions for use: Lay the picture
      flat, pour the whole contents of the bottle over it gently, so as to flood
      the entire surface; leave the liquid on the surface for six hours, then
      wipe it off briskly with a soft cloth of as large a size as can be
      conveniently used. The effect will be the most wonderful removal of all
      dirt, and a complete and brilliant metamorphosis of the present dingy
      surface of the picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left this note and the bottle myself at two o&rsquo;clock that day; then went
      home, and confidently awaited the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning our friend from the office called, announcing himself by
      a burst of laughter outside the door. Mr. Green had implicitly followed
      the directions in the letter the moment he received it&mdash;had allowed
      the &ldquo;Amsterdam Cleansing Compound&rdquo; to remain on the Rembrandt until eight
      o&rsquo;clock in the evening&mdash;had called for the softest linen cloth in the
      whole house&mdash;and had then, with his own venerable hands, carefully
      wiped off the compound, and with it the whole surface of the picture! The
      brown, the black, the Burgomaster, the breakfast, and the ray of yellow
      light, all came clean off together in considerably less than a minute of
      time. If the picture, was brought into court now, the evidence it could
      give against us was limited to a bit of plain panel, and a mass of black
      pulp rolled up in a duster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our line of defense was, of course, that the compound had been improperly
      used. For the rest, we relied with well-placed confidence on the want of
      evidence against us. Mr. Pickup wisely closed his shop for a while, and
      went off to the Continent to ransack the foreign galleries. I received my
      five and twenty pounds, rubbed out the beginning of my second Rembrandt,
      closed the back door of the workshop behind me, and there was another
      scene of my life at an end. I had but one circumstance to regret&mdash;and
      I did regret it bitterly. I was still as ignorant as ever of the young
      lady&rsquo;s name and address.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first visit was to the studio of my excellent artist-friend, whom I
      have already presented to the reader under the sympathetic name of &ldquo;Dick.&rdquo;
       He greeted me with a letter in his hand. It was addressed to me&mdash;it
      had been left at the studio a few days since; and (marvel of all marvels!)
      the handwriting was Mr. Batterbury&rsquo;s. Had this philanthropic man not done
      befriending me even yet? Were there any present or prospective advantages
      to be got out of him still? Read his letter, and judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR&mdash;Although you have forfeited by your ungentlemanly conduct
      toward myself, and your heartlessly mischievous reception of my dear wife,
      all claim upon the forbearance of the most forbearing of your relatives, I
      am disposed, from motives of regard for the tranquillity of Mrs.
      Batterbury&rsquo;s family, and of sheer good-nature so far as I am myself
      concerned, to afford you one more chance of retrieving your position by
      leading a respectable life. The situation I am enabled to offer you is
      that of secretary to a new Literary and Scientific Institution, about to
      be opened in the town of Duskydale, near which neighborhood I possess, as
      you must be aware, some landed property. The office has been placed at my
      disposal, as vice-president of the new Institution. The salary is fifty
      pounds a year, with apartments on the attic-floor of the building. The
      duties are various, and will be explained to you by the local committee,
      if you choose to present yourself to them with the inclosed letter of
      introduction. After the unscrupulous manner in which you have imposed on
      my liberality by deceiving me into giving you fifty pounds for an
      audacious caricature of myself, which it is impossible to hang up in any
      room of the house, I think this instance of my forgiving disposition still
      to befriend you, after all that has happened, ought to appeal to any
      better feelings that you may still have left, and revive the long dormant
      emotions of repentance and self-reproach, when you think on your obedient
      servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DANIEL BATTERBURY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bless me! What A long-winded style, and what a fuss about fifty pounds a
      year, and a bed in an attic! These were naturally the first emotions which
      Mr. Batterbury&rsquo;s letter produced in me. What was his real motive for
      writing it? I hope nobody will do me so great an injustice as to suppose
      that I hesitated for one instant about the way of finding <i>that</i> out.
      Of course I started off directly to inquire if Lady Malkinshaw had had
      another narrow escape of dying before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better, sir,&rdquo; answered my grandmother&rsquo;s venerable butler, wiping his
      lips carefully before he spoke; &ldquo;her ladyship&rsquo;s health has been much
      improved since her accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accident!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;What, another? Lately? Stairs again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; the drawing-room window this time,&rdquo; answered the butler, with
      semi-tipsy gravity. &ldquo;Her ladyship&rsquo;s sight having been defective of late
      years, occasions her some difficulty in calculating distances. Three days
      ago, her ladyship went to look out of the window, and, miscalculating the
      distance&mdash;&rdquo; Here the butler, with a fine dramatic feeling for telling
      a story, stopped just before the climax of the narrative, and looked me in
      the face with an expression of the deepest sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And miscalculating the distance?&rdquo; I repeated impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put her head through a pane of glass,&rdquo; said the butler, in a soft voice
      suited to the pathetic nature of the communication. &ldquo;By great good fortune
      her ladyship had been dressed for the day, and had got her turban on. This
      saved her ladyship&rsquo;s head. But her ladyship&rsquo;s neck, sir, had a very narrow
      escape. A bit of the broken glass wounded it within half a quarter of an
      inch of the carotty artery&rdquo; (meaning, probably, carotid); &ldquo;I heard the
      medical gentleman say, and shall never forget it to my dying day, that her
      ladyship&rsquo;s life had been saved by a hair-breadth. As it was, the blood
      lost (the medical gentleman said that, too, sir) was accidentally of the
      greatest possible benefit, being apoplectic, in the way of clearing out
      the system. Her ladyship&rsquo;s appetite has been improved ever since&mdash;the
      carriage is out airing of her at this very moment&mdash;likewise, she
      takes the footman&rsquo;s arm and the maid&rsquo;s up and downstairs now, which she
      never would hear of before this last accident. &lsquo;I feel ten years younger&rsquo; 
      (those were her ladyship&rsquo;s own words to me, this very day), &lsquo;I feel ten
      years younger, Vokins, since I broke the drawing-room window.&rsquo; And her
      ladyship looks it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No doubt. Here was the key to Mr. Batterbury&rsquo;s letter of forgiveness. His
      chance of receiving the legacy looked now further off than ever; he could
      not feel the same confidence as his wife in my power of living down any
      amount of starvation and adversity; and he was, therefore, quite ready to
      take the first opportunity of promoting my precious personal welfare and
      security, of which he could avail himself, without spending a farthing of
      money. I saw it all clearly, and admired the hereditary toughness of the
      Malkinshaw family more gratefully than ever. What should I do? Go to
      Duskydale? Why not? It didn&rsquo;t matter to me where I went, now that I had no
      hope of ever seeing those lovely brown eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got to my new destination the next day, presented my credentials, gave
      myself the full advantage of my high connections, and was received with
      enthusiasm and distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the new Institution torn by internal schisms even before it was
      opened to the public. Two factious governed it&mdash;a grave faction and a
      gay faction. Two questions agitated it: the first referring to the
      propriety of celebrating the opening season by a public ball, and the
      second to the expediency of admitting novels into the library. The grim
      Puritan interest of the whole neighborhood was, of course, on the grave
      side&mdash;against both dancing and novels, as proposed by local loose
      thinkers and latitudinarians of every degree. I was officially introduced
      to the debate at the height of the squabble; and found myself one of a
      large party in a small room, sitting round a long table, each man of us
      with a new pewter inkstand, a new quill pen, and a clean sheet of foolscap
      paper before him. Seeing that everybody spoke, I got on my legs along with
      the rest, and made a slashing speech on the loose-thinking side. I was
      followed by the leader of the grim faction&mdash;an unlicked curate of the
      largest dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were, so to speak, no other reason against dancing,&rdquo; said my
      reverend opponent, &ldquo;there is one unanswerable objection to it. Gentlemen!
      John the Baptist lost his head through dancing!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man of the grim faction hammered delightedly on the table, as that
      formidable argument was produced; and the curate sat down in triumph. I
      jumped up to reply, amid the counter-cheering of the loose-thinkers; but
      before I could say a word the President of the Institution and the rector
      of the parish came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both men of authority, men of sense, and fathers of charming
      daughters, and they turned the scale on the right side in no time. The
      question relating to the admission of novels was postponed, and the
      question of dancing or no dancing was put to the vote on the spot. The
      President, the rector and myself, the three handsomest and highest-bred
      men in the assembly, led the way on the liberal side, waggishly warning
      all gallant gentlemen present to beware of disappointing the young ladies.
      This decided the waverers, and the waverers decided the majority. My first
      business, as Secretary, was the drawing out of a model card of admission
      to the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next occupation was to look at the rooms provided for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duskydale Institution occupied a badly-repaired ten-roomed house, with
      a great flimsy saloon built at one side of it, smelling of paint and damp
      plaster, and called the Lecture Theater. It was the chilliest, ugliest,
      emptiest, gloomiest place I ever entered in my life; the idea of doing
      anything but sitting down and crying in it seemed to me quite
      preposterous; but the committee took a different view of the matter, and
      praised the Lecture Theater as a perfect ballroom. The Secretary&rsquo;s
      apartments were two garrets, asserting themselves in the most barefaced
      manner, without an attempt at disguise. If I had intended to do more than
      earn my first quarter&rsquo;s salary, I should have complained. But as I had not
      the slightest intention of remaining at Duskydale, I could afford to
      establish a reputation for amiability by saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Softly, the new Secretary? A most distinguished person,
      and quite an acquisition to the neighborhood.&rdquo; Such was the popular
      opinion of me among the young ladies and the liberal inhabitants. &ldquo;Have
      you seen Mr. Softly, the new Secretary? A worldly, vainglorious young man.
      The last person in England to promote the interests of our new
      Institution.&rdquo; Such was the counter-estimate of me among the Puritan
      population. I report both opinions quite disinterestedly. There is
      generally something to be said on either side of every question; and, as
      for me, I can always hold up the scales impartially, even when my own
      character is the substance weighing in them. Readers of ancient history
      need not be reminded, at this time of day, that there may be Roman virtue
      even in a Rogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objects, interests, and general business of the Duskydale Institution
      were matters with which I never thought of troubling myself on assuming
      the duties of Secretary. All my energies were given to the arrangements
      connected with the opening ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was elected by acclamation to the office of general manager of the
      entertainments; and I did my best to deserve the confidence reposed in me;
      leaving literature and science, so far as I was concerned, perfectly at
      liberty to advance themselves or not, just as they liked. Whatever my
      colleagues may have done, after I left them, nobody at Duskydale can
      accuse me of having ever been accessory to the disturbing of quiet people
      with useful knowledge. I took the arduous and universally neglected duty
      of teaching the English people how to be amused entirely on my own
      shoulders, and left the easy and customary business of making them
      miserable to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      My unhappy countrymen! (and thrice unhappy they of the poorer sort)&mdash;any
      man can preach to them, lecture to them, and form them into classes&mdash;but
      where is the man who can get them to amuse themselves? Anybody may cram
      their poor heads; but who will brighten their grave faces? Don&rsquo;t read
      story-books, don&rsquo;t go to plays, don&rsquo;t dance! Finish your long day&rsquo;s work
      and then intoxicate your minds with solid history, revel in the
      too-attractive luxury of the lecture-room, sink under the soft temptation
      of classes for mutual instruction! How many potent, grave and reverent
      tongues discourse to the popular ear in these siren strains, and how
      obediently and resignedly this same weary popular ear listens! What if a
      bold man spring up one day, crying aloud in our social wilderness, &ldquo;Play,
      for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, or you will work yourselves into a nation of
      automatons! Shake a loose leg to a lively fiddle! Women of England! drag
      the lecturer off the rostrum, and the male mutual instructor out of the
      class, and ease their poor addled heads of evenings by making them dance
      and sing with you. Accept no offer from any man who cannot be proved, for
      a year past, to have systematically lost his dignity at least three times
      a week, after office hours. You, daughters of Eve, who have that wholesome
      love of pleasure which is one of the greatest adornments of the female
      character, set up a society for the promotion of universal amusement, and
      save the British nation from the lamentable social consequences of its own
      gravity!&rdquo; Imagine a voice crying lustily after this fashion&mdash;what
      sort of echoes would it find?&mdash;Groans?
    </p>
    <p>
      I know what sort of echoes my voice found. They were so discouraging to
      me, and to the frivolous minority of pleasure-seekers, that I recommended
      lowering the price of admission so as to suit the means of any decent
      people who were willing to leave off money-grubbing and tear themselves
      from the charms of mutual instruction for one evening at least. The
      proposition was indignantly negatived by the managers of the Institution.
      I am so singularly obstinate a man that I was not to be depressed even by
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next efforts to fill the ballroom could not be blamed. I procured a
      local directory, put fifty tickets in my pocket, dressed myself in nankeen
      pantaloons and a sky-blue coat (then the height of fashion), and set forth
      to tout for dancers among all the members of the genteel population, who,
      not being notorious Puritans, had also not been so obliging as to take
      tickets for the ball. There never was any pride or bashfulness about me.
      Excepting certain periods of suspense and anxiety, I am as even-tempered a
      Rogue as you have met with anywhere since the days of Gil Blas.
    </p>
    <p>
      My temperament being opposed to doing anything with regularity, I opened
      the directory at hazard, and determined to make my first call at the first
      house that caught my eye. Vallombrosa Vale Cottages. No. 1. Doctor and
      Miss Dulcifer. Very good. I have no preferences. Let me sell the first two
      tickets there. I found the place; I opened the garden gate; I advanced to
      the door, innocently wondering what sort of people I should find inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am asked what was the true reason for this extraordinary activity on
      my part, in serving the interests of a set of people for whom I cared
      nothing, I must honestly own that the loss of my young lady was at the
      bottom of it. Any occupation was welcome which kept my mind, in some
      degree at least, from dwelling on the bitter disappointment that had
      befallen me. When I rang the bell at No. 1, did I feel no presentiment of
      the exquisite surprise in store for me? I felt nothing of the sort. The
      fact is, my digestion is excellent. Presentiments are more closely
      connected than is generally supposed with a weak state of stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked for Miss Dulcifer, and was shown into the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t expect me to describe my sensations: hundreds of sensations flew all
      over me. There she was, sitting alone, near the window! There she was,
      with nimble white fingers, working a silk purse!
    </p>
    <p>
      The melancholy in her face and manner, when I had last seen her, appeared
      no more. She was prettily dressed in maize color, and the room was well
      furnished. Her father had evidently got over his difficulties. I had been
      inclined to laugh at his odd name, when I found it in the directory! Now I
      began to dislike it, because it was her name, too. It was a consolation to
      remember that she could change it. Would she change it for mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was the first to recover; I boldly drew a chair near her and took her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is of no use to try to avoid me. This is the third
      time we have met. Will you receive me as a visitor, under these
      extraordinary circumstances? Will you give me a little happiness to
      compensate for what I have suffered since you left me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so surprised,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disagreeably surprised?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She first went on with her work, and then replied (a little sadly, as I
      thought):
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was ready enough to take advantage of my opportunities this time; but
      she contrived with perfect politeness to stop me. She seemed to remember
      with shame, poor soul, the circumstances under which I had last seen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you come to be at Duskydale?&rdquo; she inquired, abruptly changing the
      subject. &ldquo;And how did you find us out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I was giving her the necessary explanations her father came in. I
      looked at him with considerable curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall stout gentleman with impressive respectability oozing out of him at
      every pore&mdash;with a swelling outline of black-waistcoated stomach,
      with a lofty forehead, with a smooth double chin resting pulpily on a
      white cravat. Everything in harmony about him except his eyes, and these
      were so sharp, bright and resolute that they seemed to contradict the
      bland conventionality which overspread all the rest of the man. Eyes with
      wonderful intelligence and self-dependence in them; perhaps, also, with
      something a little false in them, which I might have discovered
      immediately under ordinary circumstances: but I looked at the doctor
      through the medium of his daughter, and saw nothing of him at the first
      glance but his merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are both very much indebted to you, sir, for your politeness in
      calling,&rdquo; he said, with excessive civility of manner. &ldquo;But our stay at
      this place has drawn to an end. I only came here for the re-establishment
      of my daughter&rsquo;s health. She has benefited greatly by the change of air,
      and we have arranged to return home to-morrow. Otherwise, we should have
      gladly profited by your kind offer of tickets for the ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I had one eye on the young lady while he was speaking. She was
      looking at her father, and a sudden sadness was stealing over her face.
      What did it mean? Disappointment at missing the ball? No, it was a much
      deeper feeling than that. My interest was excited. I addressed a
      complimentary entreaty to the doctor not to take his daughter away from
      us. I asked him to reflect on the irreparable eclipse that he would be
      casting over the Duskydale ballroom. To my amazement, she only looked down
      gloomily on her work while I spoke; her father laughed contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are too completely strangers here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for our loss to be felt
      by any one. From all that I can gather, society in Duskydale will be glad
      to hear of our departure. I beg your pardon, Alicia&mdash;I ought to have
      said <i>my</i> departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her name was Alicia! I declare it was a luxury to me to hear it&mdash;the
      name was so appropriate, so suggestive of the grace and dignity of her
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned toward her when the doctor had done. She looked more gloomily
      than before. I protested against the doctor&rsquo;s account of himself. He
      laughed again, with a quick distrustful lo ok, this time, at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to mention my name among your respectable inhabitants,&rdquo; he
      went on, with a strong, sneering emphasis on the word respectable, &ldquo;they
      would most likely purse up their lips and look grave at it. Since I gave
      up practice as a physician, I have engaged in chemical investigations on a
      large scale, destined I hope, to lead to some important public results.
      Until I arrive at these, I am necessarily obliged, in my own interests, to
      keep my experiments secret, and to impose similar discretion on the
      workmen whom I employ. This unavoidable appearance of mystery, and the
      strictly retired life which my studies compel me to lead, offend the
      narrow-minded people in my part of the county, close to Barkingham; and
      the unpopularity of my pursuits has followed me here. The general opinion,
      I believe, is, that I am seeking by unholy arts for the philosopher&rsquo;s
      stone. Plain man, as you see me, I find myself getting quite the
      reputation of a Doctor Faustus in the popular mind. Even educated people
      in this very place shake their heads and pity my daughter there for living
      with an alchemical parent, within easy smelling-distance of an explosive
      laboratory. Excessively absurd, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might have been excessively absurd, but the lovely Alicia sat with her
      eyes on her work, looking as if it were excessively sad, and not giving
      her father the faintest answering smile when he glanced toward her and
      laughed, as he said his last words. I could not at all tell what to make
      of it. The doctor talked of the social consequences of his chemical
      inquiries as if he were living in the middle ages. However, I was far too
      anxious to see the charming brown eyes again to ask questions which would
      be sure to keep them cast down. So I changed the topic to chemistry in
      general; and, to the doctor&rsquo;s evident astonishment and pleasure, told him
      of my own early studies in the science.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to the mention of my father, whose reputation had reached the
      ears of Doctor Dulcifer. As he told me that, his daughter looked up&mdash;the
      sun of beauty shone on me again! I touched next on my high connections,
      and on Lady Malkinshaw; I described myself as temporarily banished from
      home for humorous caricaturing, and amiable youthful wildness. She was
      interested; she smiled&mdash;and the sun of beauty shone warmer than ever!
      I diverged to general topics, and got brilliant and amusing. She laughed&mdash;the
      nightingale notes of her merriment bubbled into my ears caressingly&mdash;why
      could I not shut my eyes and listen to them? Her color rose; her face grew
      animated. Poor soul! A little lively company was but too evidently a rare
      treat to her. Under such circumstances, who would not be amusing? If she
      had said to me, &ldquo;Mr. Softly, I like tumbling,&rdquo; I should have made a clown
      of myself on the spot. I should have stood on my head (if I could), and
      been amply rewarded for the graceful exertion, if the eyes of Alicia had
      looked kindly on my elevated heels!
    </p>
    <p>
      How long I stayed is more than I can tell. Lunch came up. I eat and drank,
      and grew more amusing than ever. When I at last rose to go, the brown eyes
      looked on me very kindly, and the doctor gave me his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind trusting yourself in the clutches of Doctor Faustus,&rdquo;
       he said, with a gay smile, &ldquo;I shall be delighted to see you if you are
      ever in the neighborhood of Barkingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrung his hand, mentally relinquishing my secretaryship while I thanked
      him for the invitation. I put out my hand next to his daughter, and the
      dear friendly girl met the advance with the most charming readiness. She
      gave me a good, hearty, vigorous, uncompromising shake. O precious right
      hand! never did I properly appreciate your value until that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going out with my head in the air, and my senses in the seventh heaven, I
      jostled an elderly gentleman passing before the garden gate. I turned
      round to apologize; it was my brother in office, the estimable Treasurer
      of the Duskydale Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been half over the town looking after you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Managing
      Committee, on reflection, consider your plan of personally soliciting
      public attendance at the hall to be compromising the dignity of the
      Institution, and beg you, therefore, to abandon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is no harm done. Thus far, I have only
      solicited two persons, Doctor and Miss Dulcifer, in that delightful little
      cottage there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you have asked <i>them</i> to come to the ball!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I have. And I am sorry to say they can&rsquo;t accept the
      invitation. Why should they not be asked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because nobody visits them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should nobody visit them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Treasurer put his arm confidentially through mine, and walked me on a
      few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Doctor Dulcifer&rsquo;s name is not down in the
      Medical List.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some mistake,&rdquo; I suggested, in my off-hand way. &ldquo;Or some foreign doctor&rsquo;s
      degree not recognized by the prejudiced people in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the second place,&rdquo; continued the Treasurer, &ldquo;we have found out that he
      is not visited at Barkingham. Consequently, it would be the height of
      imprudence to visit him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! pooh! All the nonsense of narrow-minded people, because he lives a
      retired life, and is engaged in finding out chemical secrets which the
      ignorant public don&rsquo;t know how to appreciate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shutters are always up in the front top windows of his house at
      Barkingham,&rdquo; said the Treasurer, lowering his voice mysteriously. &ldquo;I know
      it from a friend resident near him. The windows themselves are barred. It
      is currently reported that the top of the house, inside, is shut off by
      iron doors from the bottom. Workmen are employed there who don&rsquo;t belong to
      the neighborhood, who don&rsquo;t drink at the public houses, who only associate
      with each other. Unfamiliar smells and noises find their way outside
      sometimes. Nobody in the house can be got to talk. The doctor, as he calls
      himself, does not even make an attempt to get into society, does not even
      try to see company for the sake of his poor unfortunate daughter. What do
      you think of all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think!&rdquo; I repeated contemptuously; &ldquo;I think the inhabitants of Barkingham
      are the best finders of mares&rsquo; nests in all England. The doctor is making
      important chemical discoveries (the possible value of which I can
      appreciate, being chemical myself), and he is not quite fool enough to
      expose valuable secrets to the view of all the world. His laboratory is at
      the top of the house, and he wisely shuts it off from the bottom to
      prevent accidents. He is one of the best fellows I ever met with, and his
      daughter is the loveliest girl in the world. What do you all mean by
      making mysteries about nothing? He has given me an invitation to go and
      see him. I suppose the next thing you will find out is, that there is
      something underhand even in that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t accept the invitation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall, at the very first opportunity; and if you had seen Miss Alicia,
      so would you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go. Take my advice and don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said the Treasurer, gravely. &ldquo;You
      are a young man. Reputable friends are of importance to you at the outset
      of life. I say nothing against Doctor Dulcifer&mdash;he came here as a
      stranger, and he goes away again as a stranger&mdash;but you can&rsquo;t be sure
      that his purpose in asking you so readily to his house is a harmless one.
      Making a new acquaintance is always a doubtful speculation; but when a man
      is not visited by his respectable neighbors&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t open his shutters,&rdquo; I interposed sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there are doubts about him and his house which he will not clear
      up,&rdquo; retorted the Treasurer. &ldquo;You can take your own way. You may turn out
      right, and we may all be wrong; I can only say again, it is rash to make
      doubtful acquaintances. Sooner or later you are always sure to repent it.
      In your place I should certainly not accept the invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my place, my dear sir,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;you would do exactly what I mean
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Treasurer took his arm out of mine, and without saying another word,
      wished me good-morning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I HAD spoken confidently enough, while arguing the question of Doctor
      Dulcifer&rsquo;s respectability with the Treasurer of the D uskydale
      Institution; but, if my perceptions had not been blinded by my
      enthusiastic admiration for Alicia, I think I should have secretly
      distrusted my own opinion as soon as I was left by myself. Had I been in
      full possession of my senses, I might have questioned, on reflection,
      whether the doctor&rsquo;s method of accounting for the suspicions which kept
      his neighbors aloof from him, was quite satisfactory. Love is generally
      described, I believe, as the tender passion. When I remember the
      insidiously relaxing effect of it on all my faculties, I feel inclined to
      alter the popular definition, and to call it a moral vapor-bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the Managing Committee of the Duskydale Institution thought of the
      change in me, I cannot imagine. The doctor and his daughter left the town
      on the day they had originally appointed, before I could make any excuse
      for calling again; and, as a necessary consequence of their departure, I
      lost all interest in the affairs of the ball, and yawned in the faces of
      the committee when I was obliged to be present at their deliberations in
      my official capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all Alicia with me, whatever they did. I read the Minutes through a
      soft medium of maize-colored skirts. Notes of melodious laughter bubbled,
      in my mind&rsquo;s ear, through all the drawling and stammering of our
      speech-making members. When our dignified President thought he had caught
      my eye, and made oratorical overtures to me from the top of the table, I
      was lost in the contemplation of silk purses and white fingers weaving
      them. I meant &ldquo;Alicia&rdquo; when I said &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;&mdash;and when I
      officially produced my subscription list, it was all aglow with the
      roseate hues of the marriage-license. If any unsympathetic male readers
      should think this statement exaggerated, I appeal to the ladies&mdash;<i>they</i>
      will appreciate the rigid, yet tender, truth of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of the ball came. I have nothing but the vaguest recollection of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that the more the perverse lecture theater was warmed the more
      persistently it smelled of damp plaster; and that the more brightly it was
      lighted, the more overgrown and lonesome it looked. I can recall to mind
      that the company assembled numbered about fifty, the room being big enough
      to hold three hundred. I have a vision still before me, of twenty out of
      these fifty guests, solemnly executing intricate figure-dances, under the
      superintendence of an infirm local dancing-master&mdash;a mere speck of
      fidgety human wretchedness twisting about in the middle of an empty floor.
      I see, faintly, down the dim vista of the Past, an agreeable figure, like
      myself, with a cocked hat under its arm, black tights on its lightly
      tripping legs, a rosette in its buttonhole, and an engaging smile on its
      face, walking from end to end of the room, in the character of Master of
      the Ceremonies. These visions and events I can recall vaguely; and with
      them my remembrances of the ball come to a close. It was a complete
      failure, and that would, of itself, have been enough to sicken me of
      remaining at the Duskydale Institution, even if I had not had any reasons
      of the tender sort for wishing to extend my travels in rural England to
      the neighborhood of Barkingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty was how to find a decent pretext for getting away.
      Fortunately, the Managing Committee relieved me of any perplexity on this
      head, by passing a resolution, one day, which called upon the President to
      remonstrate with me on my want of proper interest in the affairs of the
      Institution. I replied to the remonstrance that the affairs of the
      Institution were so hopelessly dull that it was equally absurd and unjust
      to expect any human being to take the smallest interest in them. At this
      there arose an indignant cry of &ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; from the whole committee; to
      which I answered politely, that I should be delighted to oblige the
      gentlemen, and to go forthwith, on condition of receiving a quarter&rsquo;s
      salary in the way of previous compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a sordid opposition from an economical minority, my condition of
      departure was accepted. I wrote a letter of resignation, received in
      exchange twelve pounds ten shillings, and took my place, that same day, on
      the box-seat of the Barkingham mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather changeable this life of mine, was it not? Before I was twenty-five
      years of age, I had tried doctoring, caricaturing portrait-painting, old
      picture-making, and Institution-managing; and now, with the help of
      Alicia, I was about to try how a little marrying would suit me. Surely,
      Shakespeare must have had me prophetically in his eye, when he wrote about
      &ldquo;one man in his time playing many parts.&rdquo; What a character I should have
      made for him, if he had only been alive now!
    </p>
    <p>
      I found out from the coachman, among other matters, that there was a
      famous fishing stream near Barkingham; and the first thing I did, on
      arriving at the town, was to buy a rod and line.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck me that my safest way of introducing myself would be to tell
      Doctor Dulcifer that I had come to the neighborhood for a little fishing,
      and so to prevent him from fancying that I was suspiciously prompt in
      availing myself of his offered hospitality. I put up, of course, at the
      inn&mdash;stuck a large parchment book of flies half in and half out of
      the pocket of my shooting-jacket&mdash;and set off at once to the
      doctor&rsquo;s. The waiter of whom I asked my way stared distrustfully while he
      directed me. The people at the inn had evidently heard of my new friend,
      and were not favorably disposed toward the cause of scientific
      investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house stood about a mile out of the town, in a dip of ground near the
      famous fishing-stream. It was a lonely, old-fashioned red-brick building,
      surrounded by high walls, with a garden and plantation behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rang at the gate-bell, I looked up at the house. Sure enough all the
      top windows in front were closed with shutters and barred. I was let in by
      a man in livery; who, however, in manners and appearance, looked much more
      like a workman in disguise than a footman. He had a very suspicious eye,
      and he fixed it on me unpleasantly when I handed him my card.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shown into a morning-room exactly like other morning-rooms in
      country houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long delay the doctor came in, with scientific butchers&rsquo; sleeves
      on his arms, and an apron tied round his portly waist. He apologized for
      coming down in his working dress, and said everything that was civil and
      proper about the pleasure of unexpectedly seeing me again so soon. There
      was something rather preoccupied, I thought, in those brightly resolute
      eyes of his; but I naturally attributed it to the engrossing influence of
      his scientific inquiries. He was evidently not at all taken in by my story
      about coming to Barkingham to fish; but he saw, as well as I did, that it
      would do to keep up appearances, and contrived to look highly interested
      immediately in my parchment-book. I asked after his daughter. He said she
      was in the garden, and proposed that we should go and find her. We did
      find her, with a pair of scissors in her hand, outblooming the flowers
      that she was trimming. She looked really glad to see me&mdash;her brown
      eyes beamed clear and kindly&mdash;she gave my hand another inestimable
      shake&mdash;the summer breezes waved her black curls gently upward from
      her waist&mdash;she had on a straw hat and a brown Holland gardening
      dress. I eyed it with all the practical interest of a linendraper. O Brown
      Holland you are but a coarse and cheap fabric, yet how soft and priceless
      you look when clothing the figure of Alicia!
    </p>
    <p>
      I lunched with them. The doctor recurred to the subject of my angling
      intentions, and asked his daughter if she had heard what parts of the
      stream at Barkingham were best for fishing in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, with a mixture of modest evasiveness and adorable simplicity,
      that she had sometimes seen gentlemen angling from a meadow-bank about a
      quarter of a mile below her flower-garden. I risked everything in my usual
      venturesome way, and asked if she would show me where the place was, in
      case I called the next morning with my fishing-rod. She looked dutifully
      at her father. He smiled and nodded. Inestimable parent!
    </p>
    <p>
      On rising to take leave, I was rather curious to know whether he would
      offer me a bed in the house, or not. He detected the direction of my
      thoughts in my face and manner, and apologized for not having a bed to
      offer me; every spare room in the house being occupied by his chemical
      assistants, and by the lumber of laboratories. Even while he was speaking
      those few words, Alicia&rsquo;s face changed just as I had seen it change at our
      first interview. The downcast, gloomy expression overspread it again. Her
      father&rsquo;s eye wandered toward her when mine did, and suddenly assumed the
      same distrustful look which I remembered detecting in it, under similar
      circumstances, at Duskydale. What could this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shook hands with me in the hall, leaving the workman-like
      footman to open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped to admire a fine pair of stag&rsquo;s antlers. The footman coughed
      impatiently. I still lingered, hearing the doctor&rsquo;s footsteps ascending
      the stairs. They suddenly stopped; and then there was a low heavy clang,
      like the sound of a closing door made of iron, or of some other unusually
      strong material; then total silence, interrupted by another impatient
      cough from the workman-like footman. After that, I thought my wisest
      proceeding would be to go away before my mysterious attendant was driven
      to practical extremities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between thoughts of Alicia, and inquisitive yearnings to know more about
      the doctor&rsquo;s experiments, I passed rather a restless night at my inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, I found the lovely mistress of my destiny, with the
      softest of shawls on her shoulders, the brightest of parasols in her hand,
      and the smart little straw hat of the day before on her head, ready to
      show me the way to the fishing-place. If I could be sure beforehand that
      these pages would only be read by persons actually occupied in the making
      of love&mdash;that oldest and longest-established of all branches of
      manufacturing industry&mdash;I could go into some very tender and
      interesting particulars on the subject of my first day&rsquo;s fishing, under
      the adorable auspices of Alicia. But as I cannot hope for a wholly
      sympathetic audience&mdash;as there may be monks, misogynists, political
      economists, and other professedly hard-hearted persons present among those
      whom I now address&mdash;I think it best to keep to safe generalities, and
      to describe my love-making in as few sentences as the vast, though soft,
      importance of the subject will allow me to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me confess, then, that I assumed the character of a fastidious angler,
      and managed to be a week in discovering the right place to fish in&mdash;always,
      it is unnecessary to say, under Alicia&rsquo;s guidance. We went up the stream
      and down the stream, on one side. We crossed the bridge, and went up the
      stream and down the stream on the other. We got into a punt, and went up
      the stream (with great difficulty), and down the stream (with great ease).
      We landed on a little island, and walked all round it, and inspected the
      stream attentively from a central point of view. We found the island damp,
      and went back to the bank, and up the stream, and over the bridge, and
      down the stream again; and then, for the first time, the sweet girl turned
      appealingly to me, and confessed that she had exhausted her artless
      knowledge of the locality. It was exactly a week from the day when I had
      first followed her into the fields with my fishing-rod over my shoulder;
      and I had never yet caught anything but Alicia&rsquo;s hand, and that not with
      my hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat down close together on the bank, entirely in consequence of our
      despair at not finding a good fishing-place. I looked at the brown eyes,
      and they turned away observantly down the stream. I followed them, and
      they turned away inquiringly up the stream. Was this angel of patience and
      kindness still looking for a fishing place? And was it <i>up</i> the
      stream, after all? No!&mdash;she smiled and shook her head when I asked
      the question, and the brown eyes suddenly stole a look at me. I could hold
      out no longer In one breathless moment I caught hold of both her hands&mdash;in
      one stammering sentence I asked her if she would be my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried faintly to free her hands&mdash;gave up the attempt&mdash;smiled&mdash;made
      an effort to look grave&mdash;gave that up, too&mdash;sighed suddenly&mdash;checked
      herself suddenly&mdash;said nothing. Perhaps I ought to have taken my
      answer for granted; but the least business-like man that ever lived
      becomes an eminently practical character in matters of love. I repeated my
      question. She looked away confusedly; her eye lighted on a corner of her
      father&rsquo;s red-brick house, peeping through a gap in the plantation already
      mentioned; and her blushing cheeks lost their color instantly. I felt her
      hands grow cold; she drew them resolutely out of mine, and rose with the
      tears in her eyes. Had I offended her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said when I asked her the question, and turned to me again, and
      held out her hand with such frank, fearless kindness, that I almost fell
      on my knees to thank her for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Might I hope ever to hear her say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the question that I had asked
      on the riverbank?
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed bitterly, and turned again toward the red-brick house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there any family reason against her saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;? Anything that I must
      not inquire into? Any opposition to be dreaded from her father?
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I mentioned her father, she shrank away from me and burst into
      a violent fit of crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it again!&rdquo; she said in a broken voice. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;you
      mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;ah, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t say a word more about it! I&rsquo;m not
      distressed with you&mdash;it is not your fault. Don&rsquo;t say anything&mdash;leave
      me quiet for a minute. I shall soon be better it you leave me quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dried her eyes directly, with a shiver as if it was cold, and took my
      arm. I led her back to the house-gate; and then, feeling that I could not
      go in to lunch as usual, after what had happened, said I would return to
      the fishing-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I come to dinner this evening?&rdquo; I asked, as I rang the gate-bell
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;yes!&mdash;do come, or he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious man-servant opened the door, and we parted before she could
      say the next words.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I WENT back to the fishing-place with a heavy heart, overcome by mournful
      thoughts, for the first time in my life. It was plain that she did not
      dislike me, and equally plain that there was some obstacle connected with
      her father, which forbade her to listen to my offer of marriage. From the
      time when she had accidentally looked toward the red-brick house,
      something in her manner which it is quite impossible to describe, had
      suggested to my mind that this obstacle was not only something she could
      not mention, but something that she was partly ashamed of, partly afraid
      of, and partly doubtful about. What could it be? How had she first known
      it? In what way was her father connected with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of our walks she had told me nothing about herself which was
      not perfectly simple and unsuggestive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her childhood had been passed in England. After that, she had lived with
      her father and mother at Paris, where the doctor had many friends&mdash;for
      all of whom she remembered feeling more or less dislike, without being
      able to tell why. They had then come to England, and had lived in lodgings
      in London. For a time they had been miserably poor. But, after her
      mother&rsquo;s death&mdash;a sudden death from heart disease&mdash;there had
      come a change in their affairs, which she was quite unable to explain.
      They had removed to their present abode, to give the doctor full
      accommodation for the carrying on of his scientific pursuits. He often had
      occasion to go to London; but never took her with him. The only woman at
      home now, beside herself, was an elderly person, who acted as cook and
      housekeeper, and who had been in their service for many years. It was very
      lonely sometimes not having a companion of her own age and sex; but she
      had got tolerably used to bear it, and to amuse herself with her books,
      and music, and flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far she chatted about herself quite freely; but when I tried, even in
      the vaguest manner, to lead her into discussing the causes of her
      strangely secluded life, she looked so distressed, and became so suddenly
      silent, that I naturally refrained from saying another word on that topic.
      One conclusion, however, I felt tolerably sure that I had drawn correctly
      from what she said: her father&rsquo;s conduct toward her, though not absolutely
      blamable or grossly neglectful on any point, had still never been of a
      nature to make her ardently fond of him. He performed the ordinary
      parental duties rigidly and respectably enough; but he had apparently not
      cared to win all the filial love which his daughter would have bestowed on
      a more affectionate man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after reflecting on what Alicia had told me, I began to call to mind
      what I had been able to observe for myself, I found ample materials to
      excite my curiosity in relation to the doctor, if not my distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already described how I heard the clang of the heavy door, on the
      occasion of my first visit to the red-brick house. The next day, when the
      doctor again took leave of me in the hall, I hit on a plan for seeing the
      door as well as hearing it. I dawdled on my way out, till I heard the
      clang again; then pretended to remember some important message which I had
      forgotten to give to the doctor, and with a look of innocent hurry ran
      upstairs to overtake him. The disguised workman ran after me with a shout
      of &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I was conveniently deaf to him&mdash;reached the first floor
      landing&mdash;and arrived at a door which shut off the whole staircase
      higher up; an iron door, as solid as if it belonged to a banker&rsquo;s
      strong-room, and guarded millions of money. I returned to the hall,
      inattentive to the servant&rsquo;s not over-civil remonstrances, and, saying
      that I would wait till I saw the doctor again, left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day two pale-looking men, in artisan costume, came up to the gate
      at the same time as I did, each carrying a long wooden box under his arm,
      strongly bound with iron. I tried to make them talk while we were waiting
      for admission, but neither of them would go beyond &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;; and
      both had, to my eyes, some unmistakably sinister lines in their faces. The
      next day the houskeeping cook came to the door&mdash;a buxom old woman
      with a look and a ready smile, and something in her manner which suggested
      that she had not begun life quite so respectably as she was now ending it.
      She seemed to be decidedly satisfied with my personal appearance; talked
      to me on indifferent matters with great glibness; but suddenly became
      silent and diplomatic the moment I looked toward the stair and asked
      innocently if she had to go up and down them often in the course of the
      day. As for the doctor himself he was unapproachable on the subject of the
      mysterious upper regions. If I introduced chemistry in general into the
      conversation he begged me not to spoil his happy holiday hours with his
      daughter and me, by leading him back to his work-a-day thoughts. If I
      referred to his own experiments in particular he always made a joke about
      being afraid of my chemical knowledge, and of my wishing to anticipate him
      in his discoveries. In brief, after a week&rsquo;s run of the lower regions, the
      upper part of the red-brick house and the actual nature of its owner&rsquo;s
      occupations still remained impenetrable mysteries to me, pry, ponder, and
      question as I might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking of this on the river-bank, in connection with the distressing
      scene which I had just had with Alicia, I found that the mysterious
      obstacle at which she had hinted, the mysterious life led by her father,
      and the mysterious top of the house that had hitherto defied my curiosity,
      all three connected themselves in my mind as links of the same chain. The
      obstacle to my marrying Alicia was the thing that most troubled me. If I
      only found out what it was, and if I made light of it (which I was
      resolved beforehand to do, let it be what it might), I should most
      probably end by overcoming her scruples, and taking her away from the
      ominous red-brick house in the character of my wife. But how was I to make
      the all-important discovery?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cudgeling my brains for an answer to this question, I fell at last into
      reasoning upon it, by a process of natural logic, something after this
      fashion: The mysterious top of the house is connected with the doctor, and
      the doctor is connected with the obstacle which has made wretchedness
      between Alicia and me. If I can only get to the top of the house, I may
      get also to the root of the obstacle. It is a dangerous and an uncertain
      experiment; but, come what may of it, I will try and find out, if human
      ingenuity can compass the means, what Doctor Dulcifer&rsquo;s occupation really
      is, on the other side of that iron door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having come to this resolution (and deriving, let me add, parenthetically,
      great consolation from it), the next subject of consideration was the best
      method of getting safely into the top regions of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picking the lock of the iron door was out of the question, from the
      exposed nature of the situation which that mysterious iron barrier
      occupied. My only possible way to the second floor lay by the back of the
      house. I had looked up at it two or three times, while walking in the
      garden after dinner with Alicia. What had I brought away in my memory as
      the result of that casual inspection of my host&rsquo;s back premises? Several
      fragments of useful information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, one of the most magnificent vines I had ever seen grew
      against the back wall of the house, trained carefully on a strong
      trellis-work. In the second place, the middle first-floor back window
      looked out on a little stone balcony, built on the top of the porch over
      the garden door. In the third place, the back windows of the second floor
      had been open, on each occasion when I had seen them&mdash;most probably
      to air the house, which could not be ventilated from the front during the
      hot summer weather, in consequence of the shut-up condition of all the
      windows thereabouts. In the fourth place, hard by the coach-house in which
      Doctor Dulcifer&rsquo;s neat gig was put up, there was a tool-shed, in which the
      gardener kept his short pruning-ladder. In the fifth and last place,
      outside the stable in which Doctor Dulcifer&rsquo;s blood mare lived in
      luxurious solitude, was a dog-kennel with a large mastiff chained to it
      night and day. If I could only rid myself of the dog&mdash;a gaunt,
      half-starved brute, made savage and mangy by perpetual confinement&mdash;I
      did not see any reason to despair of getting in undiscovered at one of the
      second-floor windows&mdash;provided I waited until a sufficiently late
      hour, and succeeded in scaling the garden wall at the back of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life without Alicia being not worth having, I determined to risk the thing
      that very night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back at once to the town of Barkingham, I provided myself with a
      short bit of rope, a little bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern, a small screwdriver, and a
      nice bit of beef chemically adapted for the soothing of troublesome dogs.
      I then dressed, disposed of these things neatly in my coat pockets, and
      went to the doctor&rsquo;s to dinner. In one respect, Fortune favored my
      audacity. It was the sultriest day of the whole season&mdash;surely they
      could not think of shutting up the second-floor back windows to-night!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alicia was pale and silent. The lovely brown eyes, when they looked at me,
      said as plainly as in words, &ldquo;We have been crying a great deal, Frank,
      since we saw you last.&rdquo; The little white fingers gave mine a significant
      squeeze&mdash;and that was all the reference that passed between us to
      what happened in the morning. She sat through the dinner bravely; but,
      when the dessert came, left us for the night, with a few shy, hurried
      words about the excessive heat of the weather being too much for her. I
      rose to open the door, and exchanged a last meaning look with her, as she
      bowed and went by me. Little did I think that I should have to live upon
      nothing but the remembrance of that look for many weary days that were yet
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was in excellent spirits, and almost oppressively hospitable.
      We sat sociably chatting over our claret till past eight o&rsquo;clock. Then my
      host turned to his desk to write a letter before the post want out; and I
      strolled away to smoke a cigar in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second-floor back windows all open, atmosphere as sultry as ever,
      gardener&rsquo;s pruning-ladder quite safe in the tool-shed, savage mastiff in
      his kennel crunching his bones for supper. Good. The dog will not be
      visited again tonight: I may throw my medicated bit of beef at once into
      his kennel. I acted on the idea immediately; the dog seized his piece of
      beef; I heard a snap, a wheeze, a choke, and a groan&mdash;and there was
      the mastiff disposed of, inside the kennel, where nobody could find out
      that he was dead till the time came for feeding him the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to the doctor; we had a social glass of cold brandy-and-water
      together; I lighted another cigar, and took my leave. My host being too
      respectable a man not to keep early country hours, I went away, as usual,
      about ten. The mysterious man-servant locked the gate behind me. I
      sauntered on the road back to Barkingham for about five minutes, then
      struck off sharp for the plantation, lighted my lantern with the help of
      my cigar and a brimstone match of that barbarous period, shut down the
      slide again, and made for the garden wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was formidably high, and garnished horribly with broken bottles; but it
      was also old, and when I came to pick at the mortar with my screw-driver,
      I found it reasonably rotten with age and damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      I removed four bricks to make footholes in different positions up the
      wall. It was desperately hard and long work, easy as it may sound in
      description&mdash;especially when I had to hold on by the top of the wall,
      with my flat opera hat (as we used to call it in those days) laid, as a
      guard, between my hand and the glass, while I cleared a way through the
      sharp bottle-ends for my other hand and my knees. This done, my great
      difficulty was vanquished; and I had only to drop luxuriously into a
      flower-bed on the other side of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect stillness in the garden: no sign of a light anywhere at the back
      of the house: first-floor windows all shut: second-floor windows still
      open. I fetched the pruning-ladder; put it against the side of the porch;
      tied one end of my bit of rope to the top round of it; took the other end
      in my mouth, and prepared to climb to the balcony over the porch by the
      thick vine branches and the trellis-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man who has had any real experience of life can have failed to observe
      how amazingly close, in critical situations, the grotesque and the
      terrible, the comic and the serious, contrive to tread on each other&rsquo;s
      heels. At such times, the last thing we ought properly to think of comes
      into our heads, or the least consistent event that could possibly be
      expected to happen does actually occur. When I put my life in danger on
      that memorable night, by putting my foot on the trellis-work, I absolutely
      thought of the never-dying Lady Malkinshaw plunged in refreshing slumber,
      and of the frantic exclamations Mr. Batterbury would utter if he saw what
      her ladyship&rsquo;s grandson was doing with his precious life and limbs at that
      critical moment. I am no hero&mdash;I was fully aware of the danger to
      which I was exposing myself; and yet I protest that I caught myself
      laughing under my breath, with the most outrageous inconsistency, at the
      instant when I began the ascent of the trellis-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached the balcony over the porch in safety, depending more upon the
      tough vine branches than the trellis-work during my ascent. My next
      employment was to pull up the pruning-ladder, as softly as possible, by
      the rope which I held attached to it. This done, I put the ladder against
      the house wall, listened, measured the distance to the open second-floor
      window with my eye, listened again&mdash;and, finding all quiet, began my
      second and last ascent. The ladder was comfortably long, and I was
      conveniently tall; my hand was on the window-sill&mdash;I mounted another
      two rounds&mdash;and my eyes were level with the interior of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose any one should be sleeping there!
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened at the window attentively before I ventured on taking my
      lantern out of my coatpocket. The night was so quite and airless that
      there was not the faintest rustle among the leaves in the garden beneath
      me to distract my attention. I listened. The breathing of the lightest of
      sleepers must have reached my ear, through that intense stillness, if the
      room had been a bedroom, and the bed were occupied. I heard nothing but
      the quick beat of my own heart. The minutes of suspense were passing
      heavily&mdash;I laid my other hand over the window-sill, then a moment of
      doubt came&mdash;doubt whether I should carry the adventure any further. I
      mastered my hesitation directly&mdash;it was too late for second thoughts.
      &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; I whispered to myself, and got in at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      To wait, listening again, in the darkness of that unknown region, was more
      than I had courage for. The moment I was down on the floor, I pulled the
      lantern out of my pocket and raised the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, so good&mdash;I found myself in a dirty lumber-room. Large pans,
      some of them cracked and more of them broken; empty boxes bound with iron,
      of the same sort as those I had seen the workmen bringing in at the front
      gate; old coal sacks; a packing-case full of coke; and a huge, cracked,
      mouldy blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows&mdash;these were the principal objects that I
      observed in the lumber-room. The one door leading out of it was open, as I
      had expected it would be, in order to let the air through the back window
      into the house. I took off my shoes, and stole into the passage. My first
      impulse, the moment I looked along it, was to shut down my lantern-shade,
      and listen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I heard nothing; but at the far end of the passage I saw a bright
      light pouring through the half-opened door of one of the mysterious front
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crept softly toward it. A decidedly chemical smell began to steal into
      my nostrils&mdash;and, listening again, I thought I heard above me, and in
      some distant room, a noise like the low growl of a large furnace, muffled
      in some peculiar manner. Should I retrace my steps in that direction? No&mdash;not
      till I had seen something of the room with the bright light, outside of
      which I was now standing. I bent forward softly; looking by little and
      little further and further through the opening of the door, until my head
      and shoulders were fairly inside the room, and my eyes had convinced me
      that no living soul, sleeping or waking, was in any part of it at that
      particular moment. Impelled by a fatal curiosity, I entered immediately,
      and began to look about me with eager eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw iron ladles, pans full of white sand, files with white metal left
      glittering in their teeth, molds of plaster of Paris, bags containing the
      same material in powder, a powerful machine with the name and use of which
      I was theoretically not unacquainted, white metal in a partially-fused
      state, bottles of aquafortis, dies scattered over a dresser, crucibles,
      sandpaper, bars of metal, and edged tools in plenty, of the strangest
      construction. I was not at all a scrupulous man, as the reader knows by
      this time; but when I looked at these objects, and thought of Alicia, I
      could not for the life of me help shuddering. There was not the least
      doubt about it, even after the little I had seen: the important chemical
      pursuits to which Doctor Dulcifer was devoting himself, meant, in plain
      English and in one word&mdash;Coining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Alicia know what I knew now, or did she only suspect it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Whichever way I answered that question in my own mind, I could be no
      longer at any loss for an explanation of her behavior in the meadow by the
      stream, or of that unnaturally gloomy, downcast look which overspread her
      face when her father&rsquo;s pursuits were the subject of conversation. Did I
      falter in my resolution to marry her, now that I had discovered what the
      obstacle was which had made mystery and wretchedness between us? Certainly
      not. I was above all prejudices. I was the least particular of mankind. I
      had no family affection in my way&mdash;and, greatest fact of all, I was
      in love. Under those circumstances what Rogue of any spirit would have
      faltered? After the first shock of the discovery was over, my resolution
      to be Alicia&rsquo;s husband was settled more firmly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little round table in a corner of the room furthest from the
      door, which I had not yet examined. A feverish longing to look at
      everything within my reach&mdash;to penetrate to the innermost recesses of
      the labyrinth in which I had involved myself&mdash;consumed me. I went to
      the table, and saw upon it, ranged symmetrically side by side, four
      objects which looked like thick rulers wrapped up in silver paper. I
      opened the paper at the end of one of the rulers, and found that it was
      composed of half-crowns. I had closed the paper again, and was just
      raising my head from the table over which it had been bent, when my right
      cheek came in contact with something hard and cold. I started back&mdash;looked
      up&mdash;and confronted Doctor Dulcifer, holding a pistol at my right
      temple.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE doctor (like me) had his shoes off. The doctor (like me) had come in
      without making the least noise. He cocked the pistol without saying a
      word. I felt that I was probably standing face to face with death, and I
      too said not a word. We two Rogues looked each other steadily and silently
      in the face&mdash;he, the mighty and prosperous villain, with my life in
      his hands: I, the abject and poor scamp, waiting his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been at least a minute after I heard the click of the cocked
      pistol before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet commonplace terms in which he put his question, and the perfect
      composure and politeness of his manner, reminded me a little of Gentleman
      Jones. But the doctor was much the more respectable-looking man of the
      two; his baldness was more intellectual and benevolent; there was a
      delicacy and propriety in the pulpiness of his fat white chin, a bland
      bagginess in his unwhiskered cheeks, a reverent roughness about his
      eyebrows and a fullness in his lower eyelids, which raised him far higher,
      physiognomically speaking, in the social scale, than my old prison
      acquaintance. Put a shovel-hat on Gentleman Jones, and the effect would
      only have been eccentric; put the same covering on the head of Doctor
      Dulcifer, and the effect would have been strictly episcopal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; he repeated, still without showing the least
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him how I had got in at the second-floor window, without concealing
      a word of the truth. The gravity of the situation, and the sharpness of
      the doctor&rsquo;s intellects, as expressed in his eyes, made anything like a
      suppression of facts on my part a desperately dangerous experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see what I was about up here, did you?&rdquo; said he, when I had
      ended my confession. &ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pistol barrel touched my cheek as he said the last words. I thought of
      all the suspicious objects scattered about the room, of the probability
      that he was only putting this question to try my courage, of the very
      likely chance that he would shoot me forthwith, if I began to prevaricate.
      I thought of these things, and boldly answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me reflectively; then said, in low, thoughtful tones,
      speaking, not to me, but entirely to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I shoot him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw in his eye, that if I flinched, he would draw the trigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you trust me?&rdquo; I said, without moving a muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trusted you, as an honest man, downstairs, and I find you, like a
      thief, up here,&rdquo; returned the doctor, with a self-satisfied smile at the
      neatness of his own retort. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he continued, relapsing into soliloquy:
      &ldquo;there is risk every way; but the least risk perhaps is to shoot him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;There are relations of mine who have a pecuniary
      interest in my life. I am the main condition of a contingent reversion in
      their favor. If I am missed, I shall be inquired after.&rdquo; I have wondered
      since at my own coolness in the face of the doctor&rsquo;s pistol; but my life
      depended on my keeping my self-possession, and the desperate nature of the
      situation lent me a desperate courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know you are not lying?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not spoken the truth, hitherto?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words made him hesitate. He lowered the pistol slowly to his side. I
      began to breathe freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe I would hold my tongue about
      what I have seen here, for your sake, you may be certain that I would for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my daughter&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he interposed, with a sarcastic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed with all imaginable cordiality. The doctor waved his pistol in the
      air contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two ways of making you hold your tongue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The first
      is shooting you; the second is making a felon of you. On consideration,
      after what you have said, the risk in either case seems about equal. I am
      naturally a humane man; your family have done me no injury; I will not be
      the cause of their losing money; I won&rsquo;t take your life, I&rsquo;ll have your
      character. We are all felons on this floor of the house. You have come
      among us&mdash;you shall be one of us. Ring that bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed with the pistol to a bell-handle behind me. I pulled it in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felon! The word has an ugly sound&mdash;a very ugly sound. But,
      considering how near the black curtain had been to falling over the
      adventurous drama of my life, had I any right to complain of the
      prolongation of the scene, however darkly it might look at first? Besides,
      some of the best feelings of our common nature (putting out of all
      question the value which men so unaccountably persist in setting on their
      own lives), impelled me, of necessity, to choose the alternative of
      felonious existence in preference to that of respectable death. Love and
      Honor bade me live to marry Alicia; and a sense of family duty made me
      shrink from occasioning a loss of three thousand pounds to my affectionate
      sister. Perish the far-fetched scruples which would break the heart of one
      lovely woman, and scatter to the winds the pin-money of another!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you utter one word in contradiction of anything I say when my workmen
      come into the room,&rdquo; said the doctor, uncocking his pistol as soon as I
      had rung the bell, &ldquo;I shall change my mind about leaving your life and
      taking your character. Remember that; and keep a guard on your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and four men entered. One was an old man whom I had not
      seen before; in the other three I recognized the workman-like footman, and
      the two sinister artisans whom I had met at the house-gate. They all
      started, guiltily enough, at seeing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me introduce you,&rdquo; said the doctor, taking me by the arm. &ldquo;Old File
      and Young File, Mill and Screw&mdash;Mr. Frank Softly. We have nicknames
      in this workshop, Mr. Softly, derived humorously from our professional
      tools and machinery. When you have been here long enough, you will get a
      nickname, too. Gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, turning to the workmen, &ldquo;this is
      a new recruit, with a knowledge of chemistry which will be useful to us.
      He is perfectly well aware that the nature of our vocation makes us
      suspicious of all newcomers, and he, therefore, desires to give you
      practical proof that he is to be depended on, by making half-a-crown
      immediately, and sending the same up, along with our handiwork, directed
      in his own handwriting, to our estimable correspondents in London. When
      you have all seen him do this of his own free will, and thereby put his
      own life as completely within the power of the law as we have put ours,
      you will know that he is really one of us, and will be under no
      apprehensions for the future. Take great pains with him, and as soon as he
      turns out a tolerably neat article, from the simple flatted plates, under
      your inspection, let me know. I shall take a few hours&rsquo; repose on my
      camp-bed in the study, and shall be found there whenever you want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to us all round in the most friendly manner, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked with considerable secret distrust at the four gentlemen who were
      to instruct me in the art of making false coin. Young File was the
      workman-like footman; Old File was his father; Mill and Screw were the two
      sinister artisans. The man of the company whose looks I liked least was
      Screw. He had wicked little twinkling eyes&mdash;and they followed me
      about treacherously whenever I moved. &ldquo;You and I, Screw, are likely to
      quarrel,&rdquo; I thought to myself, as I tried vainly to stare him out of
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered on my new and felonious functions forthwith. Resistance was
      useless, and calling for help would have been sheer insanity. It was
      midnight; and, even supposing the windows had not been barred, the house
      was a mile from any human habitation. Accordingly, I abandoned myself to
      fate with my usual magnanimity. Only let me end in winning Alicia, and I
      am resigned to the loss of whatever small shreds and patches of
      respectability still hang about me&mdash;such was my philosophy. I wish I
      could have taken higher moral ground with equally consoling results to my
      own feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same regard for the well-being of society which led me to abstain from
      entering into particulars on the subject of Old Master-making, when I was
      apprenticed to Mr. Ishmael Pickup, now commands me to be equally discreet
      on the kindred subject of Half-Crown-making, under the auspices of Old
      File, Young File, Mill, and Screw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me merely record that I was a kind of machine in the hands of these
      four skilled workmen. I moved from room to room, and from process to
      process, the creature of their directing eyes and guiding hands. I cut
      myself, I burned myself, I got speechless from fatigue, and giddy from
      want of sleep. In short, the sun of the new day was high in the heavens
      before it was necessary to disturb Doctor Dulcifer. It had absolutely
      taken me almost as long to manufacture a half-a-crown feloniously as it
      takes a respectable man to make it honestly. This is saying a great deal;
      but it is literally true for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking quite fresh and rosy after his night&rsquo;s sleep, the doctor inspected
      my coin with the air of a schoolmaster examining a little boy&rsquo;s exercise;
      then handed it to Old File to put the finished touches and correct the
      mistakes. It was afterward returned to me. My own hand placed it in one of
      the rouleaux of false half-crowns; and my own hand also directed the
      spurious coin, when it had been safely packed up, to a certain London
      dealer who was to be on the lookout for it by the next night&rsquo;s mail. That
      done, my initiation was so far complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent for your luggage, and paid your bill at the inn,&rdquo; said the
      doctor; &ldquo;of course in your name. You are now to enjoy the hospitality that
      I could not extend to you before. A room upstairs has been prepared for
      you. You are not exactly in a state of confinement; but, until your
      studies are completed, I think you had better not interrupt them by going
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prisoner!&rdquo; I exclaimed aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prisoner is a hard word,&rdquo; answered the doctor. &ldquo;Let us say, a guest under
      surveillance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you seriously mean that you intend to keep me shut up in this part of
      the house, at your will and pleasure?&rdquo; I inquired, my heart sinking lower
      and lower at every word I spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very spacious and airy,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;as for the lower part of
      the house, you would find no company there, so you can&rsquo;t want to go to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No company!&rdquo; I repeated faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. My daughter went away this morning for change of air and scene,
      accompanied by my housekeeper. You look astonished, my dear sir&mdash;let
      me frankly explain myself. While you were the respectable son of Doctor
      Softly, and grandson of Lady Malkinshaw, I was ready enough to let my
      daughter associate with you, and should not have objected if you had
      married her off my hands into a highly-connected family. Now, however,
      when you are nothing but one of the workmen in my manufactory of money,
      your social position is seriously altered for the worse; and, as I could
      not possibly think of you for a son-in-law, I have considered it best to
      prevent all chance of your communicating with Alicia again, by sending her
      away from this house while you are in it. You will be in it until I have
      completed certain business arrangements now in a forward state of progress&mdash;after
      that, you may go away if you please. Pray remember that you have to thank
      yourself for the position you now stand in; and do me the justice to admit
      that my conduct toward you is remarkably straightforward, and perfectly
      natural under all the circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words fairly overwhelmed me. I did not even make an attempt to
      answer them. The hard trials to my courage, endurance, and physical
      strength, through which I had passed within the last twelve hours, had
      completely exhausted all my powers of resistance. I went away speechless
      to my own room; and when I found myself alone there, burst out crying.
      Childish, was it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had been rested and strengthened by a few hours&rsquo; sleep, I found
      myself able to confront the future with tolerable calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would it be best for me to do? Ought I to attempt to make my escape?
      I did not despair of succeeding; but when I began to think of the
      consequences of success, I hesitated. My chief object now was, not so much
      to secure my own freedom, as to find my way to Alicia. I had never been so
      deeply and desperately in love with her as I was now, when I knew she was
      separated from me. Suppose I succeeded in escaping from the clutches of
      Doctor Dulcifer&mdash;might I not be casting myself uselessly on the
      world, without a chance of finding a single clew to trace her by? Suppose,
      on the other hand, that I remained for the present in the red-brick house&mdash;should
      I not by that course of conduct be putting myself in the best position for
      making discoveries?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, there was the chance that Alicia might find some
      secret means of communicating with me if I remained where I was. In the
      second place, the doctor would, in all probability, have occasion to write
      to his daughter, or would be likely to receive letters from her; and, if I
      quieted all suspicion on my account, by docile behavior, and kept my eyes
      sharply on the lookout, I might find opportunities of surprising the
      secrets of his writing-desk. I felt that I need be under no restraints of
      honor with a man who was keeping me a prisoner, and who had made an
      accomplice of me by threatening my life. Accordingly, while resolving to
      show outwardly an amiable submission to my fate, I determined at the same
      time to keep secretly on the watch, and to take the very first chance of
      outwitting Doctor Dulcifer that might happen to present itself. When we
      next met I was perfectly civil to him. He was too well-bred a man not to
      match me on the common ground of courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to congratulate you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on the improvement in your
      manner and appearance. You are beginning well, Francis. Go on as you have
      begun.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      MY first few days&rsquo; experience in my new position satisfied me that Doctor
      Dulcifer preserved himself from betrayal by a system of surveillance
      worthy of the very worst days of the Holy Inquisition itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man of us ever knew that he was not being overlooked at home, or
      followed when he went out, by another man. Peepholes were pierced in the
      wall of each room, and we were never certain, while at work, whose eye was
      observing, or whose ear was listening in secret. Though we all lived
      together, we were probably the least united body of men ever assembled
      under one roof. By way of effectually keeping up the want of union between
      us, we were not all trusted alike. I soon discovered that Old File and
      Young File were much further advanced in the doctor&rsquo;s confidence than
      Mill, Screw, or myself. There was a locked-up room, and a
      continually-closed door shutting off a back staircase, of both of which
      Old File and Young File possessed keys that were never so much as trusted
      in the possession of the rest of us. There was also a trap-door in the
      floor of the principal workroom, the use of which was known to nobody but
      the doctor and his two privileged men. If we had not been all nearly on an
      equality in the matter of wages, these distinctions would have made bad
      blood among us. As it was, nobody having reason to complain of
      unjustly-diminished wages, nobody cared about any preferences in which
      profit was not involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor must have gained a great deal of money by his skill as a
      coiner. His profits in business could never have averaged less than five
      hundred per cent; and, to do him justice, he was really a generous as well
      as a rich master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even I, as a new hand, was, in fair proportion, as well paid by the week
      as the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We, of course, had nothing to do with the passing of false money&mdash;we
      only manufactured it (sometimes at the rate of four hundred pounds&rsquo; worth
      in a week); and left its circulation to be managed by our customers in
      London and the large towns. Whatever we paid for in Barkingham was paid
      for in the genuine Mint coinage. I used often to compare my own true
      guineas, half-crowns and shillings with our imitations under the doctor&rsquo;s
      supervision, and was always amazed at the resemblance. Our scientific
      chief had discovered a process something like what is called electrotyping
      nowadays, as I imagine. He was very proud of this; but he was prouder
      still of the ring of his metal, and with reason: it must have been a nice
      ear indeed that could discover the false tones in the doctor&rsquo;s coinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had been the most scrupulous man in the world, I must still have
      received my wages, for the very necessary purpose of not appearing to
      distinguish myself invidiously from my fellow-workmen. Upon the whole, I
      got on well with them. Old File and I struck up quite a friendship. Young
      File and Mill worked harmoniously with me, but Screw and I (as I had
      foreboded) quarreled.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last man was not on good terms with his fellows, and had less of the
      doctor&rsquo;s confidence than any of the rest of us. Naturally not of a sweet
      temper, his isolated position in the house had soured him, and he rashly
      attempted to vent his ill-humor on me, as a newcomer. For some days I bore
      with him patiently; but at last he got the better of my powers of
      endurance; and I gave him a lesson in manners, one day, on the educational
      system of Gentleman Jones. He did not return the blow, or complain to the
      doctor; he only looked at me wickedly, and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be even with you
      for that, some of these days.&rdquo; I soon forgot the words and the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Old File, as I have said, I became quite friendly. Excepting the
      secrets of our prison-house, he was ready enough to talk on subjects about
      which I was curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known his present master as a young man, and was perfectly familiar
      with all the events of his career. From various conversations, at odds and
      ends of spare time, I discovered that Doctor Dulcifer had begun life as a
      footman in a gentleman&rsquo;s family; that his young mistress had eloped with
      him, taking away with her every article of value that was her own personal
      property, in the shape of jewelry and dresses; that they had lived upon
      the sale of these things for some time; and that the husband, when the
      wife&rsquo;s means were exhausted, had turned strolling-player for a year or
      two. Abandoning that pursuit, he had next become a quack-doctor, first in
      a resident, then in a vagabond capacity&mdash;taking a medical degree of
      his own conferring, and holding to it as a good traveling title for the
      rest of his life. From the selling of quack medicines he had proceeded to
      the adulterating of foreign wines, varied by lucrative evening occupation
      in the Paris gambling houses. On returning to his native land, he still
      continued to turn his chemical knowledge to account, by giving his
      services to that particular branch of our commercial industry which is
      commonly described as the adulteration of commodities; and from this he
      had gradually risen to the more refined pursuit of adulterating gold and
      silver&mdash;or, to use the common phrase again, making bad money.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Old File&rsquo;s statement, though Doctor Dulcifer had never
      actually ill-used his wife, he had never lived on kind terms with her: the
      main cause of the estrangement between them, in later years, being Mrs.
      Dulcifer&rsquo;s resolute resistance to her husband&rsquo;s plans for emerging from
      poverty, by the simple process of coining his own money. The poor woman
      still held fast by some of the principles imparted to her in happier days;
      and she was devotedly fond of her daughter. At the time of her sudden
      death, she was secretly making arrangements to leave the doctor, and find
      a refuge for herself and her child in a foreign country, under the care of
      the one friend of her family who had not cast her off. Questioning my
      informant about Alicia next, I found that he knew very little about her
      relations with her father in later years. That she must long since have
      discovered him to be not quite so respectable a man as he looked, and that
      she might suspect something wrong was going on in the house at the present
      time, were, in Old File&rsquo;s opinion, matters of certainty; but that she knew
      anything positively on the subject of her father&rsquo;s occupations, he seemed
      to doubt. The doctor was not the sort of man to give his daughter, or any
      other woman, the slightest chance of surprising his secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      These particulars I gleaned during one long month of servitude and
      imprisonment in the fatal red-brick house.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all that time not the slightest intimation reached me of Alicia&rsquo;s
      whereabouts. Had she forgotten me? I could not believe it. Unless the dear
      brown eyes were the falsest hypocrites in the world, it was impossible
      that she should have forgotten me. Was she watched? Were all means of
      communicating with me, even in secret, carefully removed from her? I
      looked oftener and oftener into the doctor&rsquo;s study as those questions
      occurred to me; but he never quitted it without locking the writing-desk
      first&mdash;he never left any papers scattered on the table, and he was
      never absent from the room at any special times and seasons that could be
      previously calculated upon. I began to despair, and to feel in my lonely
      moments a yearning to renew that childish experiment of crying, which I
      have already adverted to, in the way of confession. Moralists will be glad
      to hear that I really suffered acute mental misery at this time of my
      life. My state of depression would have gratified the most exacting of
      Methodists; and my penitent face would have made my fortune if I could
      only have been exhibited by a reformatory association on the platform of
      Exeter Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much longer was this to last? Whither should I turn my steps when I
      regained my freedom? In what direction throughout all England should I
      begin to look for Alicia?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleeping and walking&mdash;working and idling&mdash;those were now my
      constant thoughts. I did my best to prepare myself for every emergency
      that could happen; I tried to arm myself beforehand against every possible
      accident that could befall me. While I was still hard at work sharpening
      my faculties and disciplining my energies in this way, an accident befell
      the doctor, on the possibility of which I had not dared to calculate, even
      in my most hopeful moments.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONE morning I was engaged in the principal workroom with my employer. We
      were alone. Old File and his son were occupied in the garrets. Screw had
      been sent to Barkingham, accompanied, on the usual precautionary plan, by
      Mill. They had been gone nearly an hour when the doctor sent me into the
      next room to moisten and knead up some plaster of Paris. While I was
      engaged in this occupation, I suddenly heard strange voices in the large
      workroom. My curiosity was instantly excited. I drew back the little
      shutter from the peephole in the wall, and looked through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw first my old enemy, Screw, with his villainous face much paler than
      usual; next, two respectably-dressed strangers whom he appeared to have
      brought into the room; and next to them Young File, addressing himself to
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said my friend, the workman-like footman; &ldquo;but
      before these gentlemen say anything for themselves, I wish to explain, as
      they seem strangers to you, that I only let them in after I had heard them
      give the password. My instructions are to let anybody in on our side of
      the door if they can give the password. No offense, sir, but I want it to
      be understood that I have done my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, my man,&rdquo; said the doctor, in his blandest manner. &ldquo;You may
      go back to your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young File left the room, with a scrutinizing look for the two strangers
      and a suspicious frown for Screw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow us to introduce ourselves,&rdquo; began the elder of the two strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me for a moment,&rdquo; interposed the doctor. &ldquo;Where is Mill?&rdquo; he
      added, turning to Screw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing our errands at Barkingham,&rdquo; answered Screw, turning paler than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We happened to meet your two men, and to ask them the way to your house,&rdquo;
       said the stranger who had just spoken. &ldquo;This man, with a caution that does
      him infinite credit, required to know our business before he told us. We
      managed to introduce the password&mdash;&lsquo;Happy-go-lucky&rsquo;&mdash;into our
      answer. This of course quieted suspicion; and he, at our request, guided
      us here, leaving his fellow-workman, as he has just told you, to do all
      errands at Barkingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While these words were being spoken, I saw Screw&rsquo;s eyes wandering
      discontentedly and amazedly round the room. He had left me in it with the
      doctor before he went out: was he disappointed at not finding me in it on
      his return?
    </p>
    <p>
      While this thought was passing through my mind, the stranger resumed his
      explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as agents appointed to transact private business,
      out of London, for Mr. Manasseh, with whom you have dealings, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the doctor, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who owes you a little account, which we are appointed to settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; remarked the doctor, pleasantly rubbing his hands one over the
      other. &ldquo;My good friend, Mr. Manasseh, does not like to trust the post, I
      suppose? Very glad to make your acquaintance, gentlemen. Have you got the
      little memorandum about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but we think there is a slight inaccuracy in it. Have you any
      objection to let us refer to your ledger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world. Screw, go down into my private laboratory,
      open the table-drawer nearest the window, and bring up a locked book, with
      a parchment cover, which you will find in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Screw obeyed I saw a look pass between him and the two strangers which
      made me begin to feel a little uneasy. I thought the doctor noticed it
      too; but he preserved his countenance, as usual, in a state of the most
      unruffled composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a time that fellow is gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed gayly. &ldquo;Perhaps I had
      better go and get the book myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two strangers had been gradually lessening the distance between the
      doctor and themselves, ever since Screw had left the room. The last words
      were barely out of his mouth, before they both sprang upon him, and
      pinioned his arms with their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, my fine fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Manasseh&rsquo;s head agent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no go. We
      are Bow Street runners, and we&rsquo;ve got you for coining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doubt of it,&rdquo; said the doctor, with the most superb coolness. &ldquo;You
      needn&rsquo;t hold me. I&rsquo;m not fool enough to resist when I&rsquo;m fairly caught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till we&rsquo;ve searched you; and then we&rsquo;ll talk about that,&rdquo; said the
      runner.*
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor submitted to the searching with the patience of a martyr. No
      offensive weapon being found in his pockets, they allowed him to sit down
      unmolested in the nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Screw, I suppose?&rdquo; said the doctor, looking inquiringly at the officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the principal man of the two. &ldquo;We have been secretly
      corresponding with him for weeks past. We have nabbed the man who went out
      with him, and got him safe at Barkingham. Don&rsquo;t expect Screw back with the
      ledger. As soon as he has made sure that the rest of you are in the house,
      he is to fetch another man or two of our Bow Street lot, who are waiting
      outside till they hear from us. We only want an old man and a young one,
      and a third pal of yours who is a gentleman born, to make a regular
      clearance in the house. When we have once got you all, it will be the
      prettiest capture that&rsquo;s ever been made since I was in the force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What the doctor answered to this I cannot say. Just as the officer had
      done speaking, I heard footsteps approaching the room in which I was
      listening. Was Screw looking for me? I instantly closed the peephole and
      got behind the door. It opened back upon me, and, sure enough, Screw
      entered cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      An empty old wardrobe stood opposite the door. Evidently suspecting that I
      might have taken the alarm and concealed myself inside it, he approached
      it on tiptoe. On tiptoe also I followed him; and, just as his hands were
      on the wardrobe door, my hands were on his throat. He was a little man,
      and no match for me. I easily and gently laid him on his back, in a
      voiceless and half-suffocated state&mdash;throwing myself right over him,
      to keep his legs quiet. When I saw his face getting black, and his small
      eyes growing largely globular, I let go with one hand, crammed my empty
      plaster of Paris bag, which lay close by, into his mouth, tied it fast,
      secured his hands and feet, and then left him perfectly harmless, while I
      took counsel with myself how best to secure my own safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should have made my escape at once; but for what I heard the officer say
      about the men who were waiting outside. Were they waiting near or at a
      distance? Were they on the watch at the front or the back of the house? I
      thought it highly desirable to give myself a chance of ascertaining their
      whereabouts from the talk of the officers in the next room, before I
      risked the possibility of running right into their clutches on the outer
      side of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cautiously opened the peephole once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor appeared to be still on the most friendly terms with his
      vigilant guardians from Bow Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any objection to my ringing for some lunch, before we are all
      taken off to London together?&rdquo; I heard him ask in his most cheerful tones.
      &ldquo;A glass of wine and a bit of bread and cheese won&rsquo;t do you any harm,
      gentlemen, if you are as hungry as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to eat and drink, order the victuals at once,&rdquo; replied one of
      the runners, sulkily. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t happen to want anything ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry for it,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I have some of the best old Madeira in
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; retorted the officer sarcastically. &ldquo;But you see we are not
      quite such fools as we look; and we have heard of such a thing, in our
      time, as hocussed wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O fie! fie!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor merrily. &ldquo;Remember how well I am
      behaving myself, and don&rsquo;t wound my feelings by suspecting me of such
      shocking treachery as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved to a corner of the room behind him, and touched a knob in the
      wall which I had never before observed. A bell rang directly, which had a
      new tone in it to my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; said the doctor, turning round again to the runners; &ldquo;really
      too bad, gentlemen, to suspect me of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shaking his head deprecatingly, he moved back to the corner, pulled aside
      something in the wall, disclosed the mouth of a pipe which was a perfect
      novelty to me, and called down it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time I had heard that name in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Moses?&rdquo; inquired the officers both together, advancing on him
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only my servant,&rdquo; answered the doctor. He turned once more to the pipe,
      and called down it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring up the Stilton Cheese, and a bottle of the Old Madeira.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cheese we had in use at that time was of purely Dutch extraction. I
      remembered Port, Sherry, and Claret in my palmy dinner-days at the
      doctor&rsquo;s family-table; but certainly not Old Madeira. Perhaps he selfishly
      kept his best wine and his choicest cheese for his own consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said one of the runners to the other, &ldquo;you look to our civil friend
      here, and I&rsquo;ll grab Moses when he brings up the lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to see what the operation of coining is, while my man is
      getting the lunch ready?&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;It may be of use to me at the
      trial, if you can testify that I afforded you every facility for finding
      out anything you might want to know. Only mention my polite anxiety to
      make things easy and instructive from the very first, and I may get
      recommended to mercy. See here&mdash;this queer-looking machine, gentlemen
      (from which two of my men derive their nicknames), is what we call a
      Mill-and-Screw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to explain the machine with the manner and tone of a lecturer at
      a scientific institution. In spite of themselves, the officers burst out
      laughing. I looked round at Screw as the doctor got deeper into his
      explanations. The traitor was rolling his wicked eyes horribly at me. They
      presented so shocking a sight, that I looked away again. What was I to do
      next? The minutes were getting on, and I had not heard a word yet, through
      the peephole, on the subject of the reserve of Bow Street runners outside.
      Would it not be best to risk everything, and get away at once by the back
      of the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I had resolved on venturing the worst, and making my escape
      forthwith, I heard the officers interrupt the doctor&rsquo;s lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lunch is a long time coming,&rdquo; said one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moses is lazy,&rdquo; answered the doctor; &ldquo;and the Madeira is in a remote part
      of the cellar. Shall I ring again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang your ringing again!&rdquo; growled the runner, impatiently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      understand why our reserve men are not here yet. Suppose you go and give
      them a whistle, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t half like leaving you,&rdquo; returned Sam. &ldquo;This learned gentleman
      here is rather a shifty sort of chap; and it strikes me that two of us
      isn&rsquo;t a bit too much to watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Sam&rsquo;s comrade, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crash of broken crockery in the lower part of the house had followed
      that last word of the cautious officer&rsquo;s speech. Naturally, I could draw
      no special inference from the sound; but, for all that, it filled me with
      a breathless interest and suspicion, which held me irresistibly at the
      peephole&mdash;though the moment before I had made up my mind to fly from
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moses is awkward as well as lazy,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;He has dropped the
      tray! Oh, dear, dear me! he has certainly dropped the tray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take our learned friend downstairs between us,&rdquo; suggested Sam. &ldquo;I
      shan&rsquo;t be easy till we&rsquo;ve got him out of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shan&rsquo;t be easy if we don&rsquo;t handcuff him before we leave the room,&rdquo;
       returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rude conduct, gentlemen&mdash;after all that has passed, remarkably rude
      conduct,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;May I, at least, get my hat while my hands are
      at liberty? It hangs on that peg opposite to us.&rdquo; He moved toward it a few
      steps into the middle of the room while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get your hat for you. We&rsquo;ll see if there&rsquo;s
      anything inside it or not, before you put it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stood stockstill, like a soldier at the word, Halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll get the handcuffs,&rdquo; said the other runner, searching his
      coat-pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor bowed to him assentingly and forgivingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only oblige me with my hat, and I shall be quite ready for you,&rdquo; he said&mdash;paused
      for one moment, then repeated the words, &ldquo;Quite ready,&rdquo; in a louder tone&mdash;and
      instantly disappeared through the floor!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the two officers rush from opposite ends of the room to a great
      opening in the middle of it. The trap-door on which the doctor had been
      standing, and on which he had descended, closed up with a bang at the same
      moment; and a friendly voice from the lower regions called out gayly,
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers next made for the door of the room. It had been locked from
      the other side. As they tore furiously at the handle, the roll of the
      wheels of the doctor&rsquo;s gig sounded on the drive in front of the house; and
      the friendly voice called out once more, &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited just long enough to see the baffled officers unbarring the window
      shutters for the purpose of giving the alarm, before I closed the
      peephole, and with a farewell look at the distorted face of my prostrate
      enemy, Screw, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s study-door was open as I passed it on my way downstairs. The
      locked writing-desk, which probably contained the only clew to Alicia&rsquo;s
      retreat that I was likely to find, was in its usual place on the table.
      There was no time to break it open on the spot. I rolled it up in my
      apron, took it off bodily under my arm, and descended to the iron door on
      the staircase. Just as I was within sight of it, it was opened from the
      landing on the other side. I turned to run upstairs again, when a familiar
      voice cried, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; and looking round, I beheld Young File.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s off with the governor in the gig, and the
      runners in hiding outside are in full cry after them. If Bow Street can
      get within pistol-shot of the blood mare, all I can say is, I give Bow
      Street full leave to fire away with both barrels! Where&rsquo;s Screw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gagged by me in the casting-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, you! Got all your things, I see, under your arm? Wait two
      seconds while I grab my money. Never mind the rumpus upstairs&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      nobody outside to help them; and the gate&rsquo;s locked, if there was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted past me up the stairs. I could hear the imprisoned officers
      shouting for help from the top windows. Their reserve men must have been
      far away, by this time, in pursuit of the gig; and there was not much
      chance of their getting useful help from any stray countryman who might be
      passing along the road, except in the way of sending a message to
      Barkingham. Anyhow we were sure of a half hour to escape in, at the very
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said Young File, rejoining me; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s be off by the back way
      through the plantations. How came you to lay your lucky hands on Screw?&rdquo;
       he continued, when we had passed through the iron door, and had closed it
      after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me first how the doctor managed to make a hole in the floor just in
      the nick of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! did you see the trap sprung?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil you did! Had you any notion that signals were going on, all the
      while you were on the watch? We have a regular set of them in case of
      accidents. It&rsquo;s a rule that father, and me, and the doctor are never to be
      in the workroom together&mdash;so as to keep one of us always at liberty
      to act on the signals.&mdash;Where are you going to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to get the gardener&rsquo;s ladder to help us over the wall. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first signal is a private bell&mdash;that means, <i>Listen at the
      pipe.</i> The next is a call down the pipe for &lsquo;Moses&rsquo;&mdash;that means,
      <i>Danger! Lock the door.</i> &lsquo;Stilton Cheese&rsquo; means, <i>Put the Mare to;</i>
      and &lsquo;Old Madeira&rsquo; <i>Stand by the trap.</i> The trap works in that
      locked-up room you never got into; and when our hands are on the
      machinery, we are awkward enough to have a little accident with the
      luncheon tray. &lsquo;Quite Ready&rsquo; is the signal to lower the trap, which we do
      in the regular theater-fashion. We lowered the doctor smartly enough, as
      you saw, and got out by the back staircase. Father went in the gig, and I
      let them out and locked the gates after them. Now you know as much as I&rsquo;ve
      got breath to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We scaled the wall easily by the help of the ladder. When we were down on
      the other side, Young File suggested that the safest course for us was to
      separate, and for each to take his own way. We shook hands and parted. He
      went southward, toward London, and I went westward, toward the sea-coast,
      with Doctor Dulcifer&rsquo;s precious writing-desk safe under my arm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FOR a couple of hours I walked on briskly, careless in what direction I
      went, so long as I kept my back turned on Barkingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I had put seven miles of ground, according to my calculations,
      between me and the red-brick house, I began to look upon the doctor&rsquo;s
      writing-desk rather in the light of an incumbrance, and determined to
      examine it without further delay. Accordingly I picked up the first large
      stone I could find in the road, crossed a common, burst through a hedge,
      and came to a halt, on the other side, in a thick wood. Here, finding
      myself well screened from public view, I broke open the desk with the help
      of the stone, and began to look over the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my unspeakable disappointment I found but few papers of any kind to
      examine. The desk was beautifully fitted with all the necessary materials
      for keeping up a large correspondence; but there were not more than half a
      dozen letters in it altogether. Four were on business matters, and the
      other two were of a friendly nature, referring to persons and things in
      which I did not feel the smallest interest. I found besides half a dozen
      bills receipted (the doctor was a mirror of punctuality in the payment of
      tradesmen), note and letter-paper of the finest quality, clarified pens, a
      pretty little pin-cushion, two small account-books filled with the neatest
      entries, and some leaves of blotting-paper. Nothing else; absolutely
      nothing else, in the treacherous writing-desk on which I had implicitly
      relied to guide me to Alicia&rsquo;s hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I groaned in sheer wretchedness over the destruction of all my dearest
      plans and hopes. If the Bow Street runners had come into the plantation
      just as I had completed the rifling of the desk I think I should have let
      them take me without making the slightest effort at escape. As it was, no
      living soul appeared within sight of me. I must have sat at the foot of a
      tree for full half an hour, with the doctor&rsquo;s useless bills and letters
      before me, with my head in my hands, and with all my energies of body and
      mind utterly crushed by despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the half hour, the natural restlessness of my faculties
      began to make itself felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever may be said about it in books, no emotion in this world ever did,
      or ever will, last for long together. The strong feeling may return over
      and over again; but it must have its constant intervals of change or
      repose. In real life the bitterest grief doggedly takes its rest and dries
      its eyes; the heaviest despair sinks to a certain level, and stops there
      to give hope a chance of rising, in spite of us. Even the joy of an
      unexpected meeting is always an imperfect sensation, for it never lasts
      long enough to justify our secret anticipations&mdash;our happiness
      dwindles to mere every-day contentment before we have half done with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised my head, and gathered the bills and letters together, and stood
      up a man again, wondering at the variableness of my own temper, at the
      curious elasticity of that toughest of all the vital substances within us,
      which we call Hope. &ldquo;Sitting and sighing at the foot of this tree,&rdquo; I
      thought, &ldquo;is not the way to find Alicia, or to secure my own safety. Let
      me circulate my blood and rouse my ingenuity, by taking to the road
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I forced my way back to the open side of the hedge, I thought it
      desirable to tear up the bills and letters, for fear of being traced by
      them if they were found in the plantation. The desk I left where it was,
      there being no name on it. The note-paper and pens I pocketed&mdash;forlorn
      as my situation was, it did not authorize me to waste stationery. The
      blotting-paper was the last thing left to dispose of: two neatly-folded
      sheets, quite clean, except in one place, where the impression of a few
      lines of writing appeared. I was about to put the blotting-paper into my
      pocket after the pens, when something in the look of the writing impressed
      on it, stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four blurred lines appeared of not more than two or three words each,
      running out one beyond another regularly from left to right. Had the
      doctor been composing poetry and blotting it in a violent hurry? At a
      first glance, that was more than I could tell. The order of the written
      letters, whatever they might be, was reversed on the face of the
      impression taken of them by the blotting-paper. I turned to the other side
      of the leaf. The order of the letters was now right, but the letters
      themselves were sometimes too faintly impressed, sometimes too much
      blurred together to be legible. I held the leaf up to the light&mdash;and
      there was a complete change: the blurred letters grew clearer, the
      invisible connecting lines appeared&mdash;I could read the words from
      first to last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writing must have been hurried, and it had to all appearance been
      hurriedly dried toward the corner of a perfectly clean leaf of the
      blotting-paper. After twice reading, I felt sure that I had made out
      correctly the following address:
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Giles, 2 Zion Place, Crickgelly, N. Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard under the circumstances, to form an opinion as to the
      handwriting; but I thought I could recognize the character of some of the
      doctor&rsquo;s letters, even in the blotted impression of them. Supposing I was
      right, who was Miss Giles?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some Welsh friend of the doctor&rsquo;s, unknown to me? Probably enough. But why
      not Alicia herself under an assumed name? Having sent her from home to
      keep her out of my way, it seemed next to a certainty that her father
      would take all possible measures to prevent my tracing her, and would,
      therefore, as a common act of precaution, forbid her to travel under her
      own name. Crickgelly, North Wales, was assuredly a very remote place to
      banish her to; but then the doctor was not a man to do things by halves:
      he knew the lengths to which my cunning and resolution were capable of
      carrying me; and he would have been innocent indeed if he had hidden his
      daughter from me in any place within reasonable distance of Barkingham.
      Last, and not least important, Miss Giles sounded in my ears exactly like
      an assumed name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there ever any woman absolutely and literally named Miss Giles?
      However I may have altered my opinion on this point since, my mind was not
      in a condition at that time to admit the possible existence of any such
      individual as a maiden Giles. Before, therefore, I had put the precious
      blotting-paper into my pocket, I had satisfied myself that my first duty,
      under all the circumstances, was to shape my flight immediately to
      Crickgelly. I could be certain of nothing&mdash;not even of identifying
      the doctor&rsquo;s handwriting by the impression on the blotting-paper. But
      provided I kept clear of Barkingham, it was all the same to me what part
      of the United Kingdom I went to; and, in the absence of any actual clew to
      her place of residence, there was consolation and encouragement even in
      following an imaginary trace. My spirits rose to their natural height as I
      struck into the highroad again, and beheld across the level plain the
      smoke, chimneys, and church spires of a large manufacturing town. There I
      saw the welcome promise of a coach&mdash;the happy chance of making my
      journey to Crickgelly easy and rapid from the very outset.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my way to the town, I was reminded by the staring of all the people I
      passed on the road, of one important consideration which I had hitherto
      most unaccountably overlooked&mdash;the necessity of making some radical
      change in my personal appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no cause to dread the Bow Street runners, for not one of them had
      seen me; but I had the strongest possible reasons for distrusting a
      meeting with my enemy, Screw. He would certainly be made use of by the
      officers for the purpose of identifying the companions whom he had
      betrayed; and I had the best reasons in the world to believe that he would
      rather assist in the taking of me than in the capture of all the rest of
      the coining gang put together&mdash;the doctor himself not excepted. My
      present costume was of the dandy sort&mdash;rather shabby, but gay in
      color and outrageous in cut. I had not altered it for an artisan&rsquo;s suit in
      the doctor&rsquo;s house, because I never had any intention of staying there a
      day longer than I could possibly help. The apron in which I had wrapped
      the writing-desk was the only approach I had made toward wearing the
      honorable uniform of the workingman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it be wise now to make my transformation complete, by adding to the
      apron a velveteen jacket and a sealskin cap? No: my hands were too white,
      my manners too inveterately gentleman-like, for all artisan disguise. It
      would be safer to assume a serious character&mdash;to shave off my
      whiskers, crop my hair, buy a modest hat and umbrella, and dress entirely
      in black. At the first slopshop I encountered in the suburbs of the town,
      I got a carpet-bag and a clerical-looking suit. At the first easy
      shaving-shop I passed, I had my hair cropped and my whiskers taken off.
      After that I retreated again to the country&mdash;walked back till I found
      a convenient hedge down a lane off the highroad&mdash;changed my upper
      garments behind it, and emerged, bashful, black, and reverend, with my
      cotton umbrella tucked modestly under my arm, my eyes on the ground, my
      head in the air, and my hat off my forehead. When I found two laborers
      touching their caps to me on my way back to the town, I knew that it was
      all right, and that I might now set the vindictive eyes of Screw himself
      safely at defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not the most distant notion where I was when I reached the High
      Street, and stopped at The Green Bull Hotel and Coach-office. However, I
      managed to mention my modest wishes to be conveyed at once in the
      direction of Wales, with no more than a becoming confusion of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was not so encouraging as I could have wished. The coach to
      Shrewsbury had left an hour before, and there would be no other public
      conveyance running in my direct ion until the next morning. Finding myself
      thus obliged to yield to adverse circumstances, I submitted resignedly,
      and booked a place outside by the next day&rsquo;s coach, in the name of the
      Reverend John Jones. I thought it desirable to be at once unassuming and
      Welsh in the selection of a traveling name; and therefore considered John
      Jones calculated to fit me, in my present emergency, to a hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      After securing a bed at the hotel, and ordering a frugal curate&rsquo;s dinner
      (bit of fish, two chops, mashed potatoes, semolina pudding, half-pint of
      sherry), I sallied out to look at the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing the name of it, and not daring to excite surprise by asking, I
      found the place full of vague yet mysterious interest. Here I was,
      somewhere in central England, just as ignorant of localities as if I had
      been suddenly deposited in Central Africa. My lively fancy revelled in the
      new sensation. I invented a name for the town, a code of laws for the
      inhabitants, productions, antiquities, chalybeate springs, population,
      statistics of crime, and so on, while I walked about the streets, looked
      in at the shop-windows, and attentively examined the Market-place and
      Town-hall. Experienced travelers, who have exhausted all novelties, would
      do well to follow my example; they may be certain, for one day at least,
      of getting some fresh ideas, and feeling a new sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to dinner in the coffee-room, I found all the London papers
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Morning Post</i> happened to lie uppermost, so I took it away to my
      own seat to occupy the time, while my unpretending bit of fish was frying.
      Glancing lazily at the advertisements on the first page, to begin with, I
      was astonished by the appearance of the following lines, at the top of a
      column:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If F&mdash; &mdash;K S&mdash;FTL&mdash;Y will communicate with his
      distressed and alarmed relatives, Mr. and Mrs. B&mdash;TT&mdash;RB&mdash;RY,
      he will hear of something to his advantage, and may be assured that all
      will be once more forgiven. A&mdash;B&mdash;LLA entreats him to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What, in the name of all that is most mysterious, does this mean! was my
      first thought after reading the advertisement. Can Lady Malkinshaw have
      taken a fresh lease of that impregnable vital tenement, at the door of
      which Death has been knocking vainly for so many years past? (Nothing more
      likely.) Was my felonious connection with Doctor Dulcifer suspected? (It
      seemed improbable.) One thing, however, was certain: I was missed, and the
      Batterburys were naturally anxious about me&mdash;anxious enough to
      advertise in the public papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I debated with myself whether I should answer their pathetic appeal or
      not. I had all my money about me (having never let it out of my own
      possession during my stay in the red-brick house), and there was plenty of
      it for the present; so I thought it best to leave the alarm and distress
      of my anxious relatives unrelieved for a little while longer, and to
      return quietly to the perusal of the <i> Morning Post.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes of desultory reading brought me unexpectedly to an
      explanation of the advertisement, in the shape of the following paragraph:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ALARMING ILLNESS OF LADY MALKINSHAW.&mdash;We regret to announce that
      this venerable lady was seized with an alarming illness on Saturday last,
      at her mansion in town. The attack took the character of a fit&mdash;of
      what precise nature we have not been able to learn. Her ladyship&rsquo;s medical
      attendant and near relative, Doctor Softly, was immediately called in, and
      predicted the most fatal results. Fresh medical attendance was secured,
      and her ladyship&rsquo;s nearest surviving relatives, Mrs. Softly, and Mr. and
      Mrs. Batterbury, of Duskydale Park, were summoned. At the time of their
      arrival her ladyship&rsquo;s condition was comatose, her breathing being highly
      stertorous. If we are rightly informed, Doctor Softly and the other
      medical gentlemen present gave it as their opinion that if the pulse of
      the venerable sufferer did not rally in the course of a quarter of an hour
      at most, very lamentable results might be anticipated. For fourteen
      minutes, as our reporter was informed, no change took place; but, strange
      to relate, immediately afterward her ladyship&rsquo;s pulse rallied suddenly in
      the most extraordinary manner. She was observed to open her eyes very
      wide, and was heard, to the surprise and delight of all surrounding the
      couch, to ask why her ladyship&rsquo;s usual lunch of chicken-broth with a glass
      of Amontillado sherry was not placed on the table as usual. These
      refreshments having been produced, under the sanction of the medical
      gentlemen, the aged patient partook of them with an appearance of the
      utmost relish. Since this happy alteration for the better, her ladyship&rsquo;s
      health has, we rejoice to say, rapidly improved; and the answer now given
      to all friendly and fashionable inquirers is, in the venerable lady&rsquo;s own
      humorous phraseology, &lsquo;Much better than could be expected.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well done, my excellent grandmother! my firm, my unwearied, my undying
      friend! Never can I say that my case is desperate while you can swallow
      your chicken-broth and sip your Amontillado sherry. The moment I want
      money, I will write to Mr. Batterbury, and cut another little golden slice
      out of that possible three-thousand-pound-cake, for which he has already
      suffered and sacrificed so much. In the meantime, O venerable protectress
      of the wandering Rogue! let me gratefully drink your health in the
      nastiest and smallest half-pint of sherry this palate ever tasted, or
      these eyes ever beheld!
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed that night in great spirits. My luck seemed to be returning
      to me; and I began to feel more than hopeful of really discovering my
      beloved Alicia at Crickgelly, under the alias of Miss Giles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the Rev. John Jones descended to breakfast so rosy,
      bland, and smiling, that the chambermaids simpered as he tripped by them
      in the passage, and the landlady bowed graciously as he passed her parlor
      door. The coach drove up, and the reverend gentleman (after waiting
      characteristically for the woman&rsquo;s ladder) mounted to his place on the
      roof, behind the coachman. One man sat there who had got up before him&mdash;and
      who should that man be, but the chief of the Bow Street runners, who had
      rashly tried to take Doctor Dulcifer into custody!
    </p>
    <p>
      There could not be the least doubt of his identity; I should have known
      his face again among a hundred. He looked at me as I took my place by his
      side, with one sharp searching glance&mdash;then turned his head away
      toward the road. Knowing that he had never set eyes on my face (thanks to
      the convenient peephole at the red-brick house), I thought my meeting with
      him was likely to be rather advantageous than otherwise. I had now an
      opportunity of watching the proceedings of one of our pursuers, at any
      rate&mdash;and surely this was something gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine morning, sir,&rdquo; I said politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied in the gruffest of monosyllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not offended: I could make allowance for the feelings of a man who
      had been locked up by his own prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine morning, indeed,&rdquo; I repeated, soothingly and cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The runner only grunted this time. Well, well! we all have our little
      infirmities. I don&rsquo;t think the worse of the man now, for having been rude
      to me, that morning, on the top of the Shrewsbury coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next passenger who got up and placed himself by my side was a florid,
      excitable, confused-looking gentleman, excessively talkative and familiar.
      He was followed by a sulky agricultural youth in top-boots&mdash;and then,
      the complement of passengers on our seat behind the coachman was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard the news, sir?&rdquo; said the florid man, turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I am aware of,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most tremendous thing that has happened these fifty years,&rdquo; said
      the florid man. &ldquo;A gang of coiners, sir, discovered at Barkingham&mdash;in
      a house they used to call the Grange. All the dreadful lot of bad silver
      that&rsquo;s been about, they&rsquo;re at the bottom of. And the head of the gang not
      taken!&mdash;escaped, sir, like a ghost on the stage, through a trap-door,
      after actually locking the runners into his workshop. The blacksmiths from
      Barkingham had to break them out; the whole house was found full of iron
      doors, back staircases, and all that sort of thing, just like the
      Inquisition. A most respectable man, the original proprietor! Think what a
      misfortune to have let his house to a scoundrel who has turned the whole
      inside into traps, furnaces, and iron doors. The fellow&rsquo;s reference, sir,
      was actually at a London bank, where he kept a first-rate account. What is
      to become of society? where is our protection? Where are our characters,
      when we are left at the mercy of scoundrels? The times are awful&mdash;upon
      my soul, the times we live in are perfectly awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir, is there any chance of catching this coiner?&rdquo; I inquired
      innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, sir; for the sake of outraged society, I hope so,&rdquo; said the
      excitable man. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve printed handbills at Barkingham, offering a reward
      for taking him. I was with my friend the mayor, early this morning, and
      saw them issued. &lsquo;Mr. Mayor,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going West&mdash;give me a few
      copies&mdash;let me help to circulate them&mdash;for the sake of outraged
      society, let me help to circulate them. Here they are&mdash;take a few,
      sir, for distribution. You&rsquo;ll see these are three other fellows to be
      caught besides the principal rascal&mdash;one of them a scamp belonging to
      a respectable family. Oh! what times! Take three copies, and pray
      circulate them in three influential quarters. Perhaps that gentleman next
      you would like a few. Will you take three, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Bow Street runner doggedly. &ldquo;Nor yet one of &lsquo;em&mdash;and
      it&rsquo;s my opinion that the coining-gang would be nabbed all the sooner, if
      you was to give over helping the law to catch them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer produced a vehement expostulation from my excitable neighbor,
      to which I paid little attention, being better engaged in reading the
      handbill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It described the doctor&rsquo;s personal appearance with remarkable accuracy,
      and cautioned persons in seaport towns to be on the lookout for him. Old
      File, Young File, and myself were all dishonorably mentioned together in a
      second paragraph, as runaways of inferior importance Not a word was said
      in the handbill to show that the authorities at Barkingham even so much as
      suspected the direction in which any one of us had escaped. This would
      have been very encouraging, but for the presence of the runner by my side,
      which looked as if Bow Street had its suspicions, however innocent
      Barkingham might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could the doctor have directed his flight toward Crickgelly? I trembled
      internally as the question suggested itself to me. Surely he would prefer
      writing to Miss Giles to join him when he got to a safe place of refuge,
      rather than encumber himself with the young lady before he was well out of
      reach of the far-stretching arm of the law. This seemed infinitely the
      most natural course of conduct. Still, there was the runner traveling
      toward Wales&mdash;and not certainly without a special motive. I put the
      handbills in my pocket, and listened for any hints which might creep out
      in his talk; but he perversely kept silent. The more my excitable neighbor
      tried to dispute with him, the more contemptuously he refused to break
      silence. I began to feel vehemently impatient for our arrival at
      Shrewsbury; for there only could I hope to discover something more of my
      formidable fellow-traveler&rsquo;s plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach stopped for dinner; and some of our passengers left us, the
      excitable man with the handbills among the number. I got down, and stood
      on the doorstep of the inn, pretending to be looking about me, but in
      reality watching the movements of the runner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather to my surprise, I saw him go to the door of the coach and speak to
      one of the inside passengers. After a short conversation, of which I could
      not hear one word, the runner left the coach door and entered the inn,
      called for a glass of brandy and water, and took it out to his friend, who
      had not left the vehicle. The friend bent forward to receive it at the
      window. I caught a glimpse of his face, and felt my knees tremble under me&mdash;it
      was Screw himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Screw, pale and haggard-looking, evidently not yet recovered from the
      effect of my grip on his throat! Screw, in attendance on the runner,
      traveling inside the coach in the character of an invalid. He must be
      going this journey to help the Bow Street officers to identify some one of
      our scattered gang of whom they were in pursuit. It could not be the
      doctor&mdash;the runner could discover him without assistance from
      anybody. Why might it not be me?
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to think whether it would be best to trust boldly in my disguise,
      and my lucky position outside the coach, or whether I should abandon my
      fellow-passengers immediately. It was not easy to settle at once which
      course was the safest&mdash;so I tried the effect of looking at my two
      alternatives from another point of view. Should I risk everything, and go
      on resolutely to Crickgelly, on the chance of discovering that Alicia and
      Miss Giles were one and the same person&mdash;or should I give up on the
      spot the only prospect of finding my lost mistress, and direct my
      attention entirely to the business of looking after my own safety?
    </p>
    <p>
      As the latter alternative practically resolved itself into the simple
      question of whether I should act like a man who was in love, or like a man
      who was not, my natural instincts settled the difficulty in no time. I
      boldly imitated the example of my fellow-passengers, and went in to
      dinner, determined to go on afterward to Crickgelly, though all Bow Street
      should be following at my heels.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SECURE as I tried to feel in my change of costume, my cropped hair, and my
      whiskerless cheeks, I kept well away from the coach-window, when the
      dinner at the inn was over and the passengers were called to take their
      places again. Thus far&mdash;thanks to the strength of my grasp on his
      neck, which had left him too weak to be an outside passenger&mdash;Screw
      had certainly not seen me; and, if I played my cards properly, there was
      no reason why he should see me before we got to our destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the rest of the journey I observed the strictest caution, and
      fortune seconded my efforts. It was dark when we got to Shrewsbury. On
      leaving the coach I was enabled, under cover of the night, to keep a sharp
      watch on the proceedings of Screw and his Bow Street ally. They did not
      put up at the hotel, but walked away to a public house. There, my clerical
      character obliged me to leave them at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the hotel, to make inquiries about conveyances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answers informed me that Crickgelly was a little fishing-village, and
      that there was no coach direct to it, but that two coaches running to two
      small Welsh towns situated at nearly equal distances from my destination,
      on either side of it, would pass through Shrewsbury the next morning. The
      waiter added, that I could book a place&mdash;conditionally&mdash;by
      either of these vehicles; and that, as they were always well-filled, I had
      better be quick in making my choice between them. Matters had now arrived
      at such a pass, that nothing was left for me but to trust to chance. If I
      waited till the morning to see whether Screw and the Bow Street runner
      traveled in my direction, and to find out, in case they did, which coach
      they took, I should be running the risk of losing a place for myself, and
      so delaying my journey for another day. This was not to be thought of. I
      told the waiter to book me a place in which coach he pleased. The two were
      called respectively The Humming Bee, and The Red Cross Knight. The waiter
      chose the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep was not much in my way that night. I rose almost as early as Boots
      himself&mdash;breakfasted&mdash;then sat at the coffee-room window looking
      out anxiously for the two coaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody seemed to agree which would pass first. Each of the inn servants of
      whom I inquired made it a matter of partisanship, and backed his favorite
      coach with the most consummate assurance. At last, I heard the guard&rsquo;s
      horn and the clatter of the horses&rsquo; hoofs. Up drove a coach&mdash;I looked
      out cautiously&mdash;it was the Humming Bee. Three outside places were
      vacant; one behind the coachman; two on the dickey. The first was taken
      immediately by a farmer, the second&mdash;-to my unspeakable disgust and
      terror&mdash;was secured by the inevitable Bow Street runner; who, as soon
      as h e was up, helped the weakly Screw into the third place, by his side.
      They were going to Crickgelly; not a doubt of it, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew mad with impatience for the arrival of the Red Cross Knight.
      Half-an-hour passed&mdash;forty minutes&mdash;and then I heard another
      horn and another clatter&mdash;and the Red Cross Knight rattled up to the
      hotel door at full speed. What if there should be no vacant place for me!
      I ran to the door with a sinking heart. Outside, the coach was declared to
      be full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one inside place,&rdquo; said the waiter, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind paying
      the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could say the rest, I was occupying that one inside place. I
      remember nothing of the journey from the time we left the hotel door,
      except that it was fearfully long. At some hour of the day with which I
      was not acquainted (for my watch had stopped for want of winding up), I
      was set down in a clean little street of a prim little town (the name of
      which I never thought of asking), and was told that the coach never went
      any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      No post-chaise was to be had. With incredible difficulty I got first a
      gig, then a man to drive it; and, last, a pony to draw it. We hobbled away
      crazily from the inn door. I thought of Screw and the Bow Street runner
      approaching Crickgelly, from their point of the compass, perhaps at the
      full speed of a good post-chaise&mdash;I thought of that, and would have
      given all the money in my pocket for two hours&rsquo; use of a fast road-hack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judging by the time we occupied in making the journey, and a little also
      by my own impatience, I should say that Crickgelly must have been at least
      twenty miles distant from the town where I took the gig. The sun was
      setting, when we first heard, through the evening stillness, the sound of
      the surf on the seashore. The twilight was falling as we entered the
      little fishing village, and let our unfortunate pony stop, for the last
      time, at a small inn door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first question I asked of the landlord was, whether two gentlemen
      (friends of mine, of course, whom I expected to meet) had driven into
      Crickgelly, a little while before me. The reply was in the negative; and
      the sense of relief it produced seemed to rest me at once, body and mind,
      after my long and anxious journey. Either I had beaten the spies on the
      road, or they were not bound to Crickgelly. Any way, I had first
      possession of the field of action. I paid the man who had driven me, and
      asked my way to Zion Place. My directions were simple&mdash;I had only to
      go through the village, and I should find Zion Place at the other end of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village had a very strong smell, and a curious habit of building boats
      in the street between intervals of detached cottages; a helpless, muddy,
      fishy little place. I walked through it rapidly; turned inland a few
      hundred yards; ascended some rising ground; and discerned, in the dim
      twilight, four small lonesome villas standing in pairs, with a shed and a
      saw-pit on one side, and a few shells of unfinished houses on the other.
      Some madly speculative builder was evidently trying to turn Crickgelly
      into a watering-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made out Number Two, and discovered the bell-handle with difficulty, it
      was growing so dark. A servant-maid&mdash;corporeally enormous; but, as I
      soon found, in a totally undeveloped state, mentally&mdash;opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Miss Giles live here?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see no visitors,&rdquo; answered the large maiden. &ldquo;&lsquo;T&rsquo;other one tried it
      and had to go away. You go, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T&rsquo;othor one?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Another visitor? And when did he call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there nobody with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t see no visitors. He went. You go, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as she repeated that exasperating formula of words, a door opened at
      the end of the passage. My voice had evidently reached the ears of
      somebody in the back parlor. Who the person was I could not see, but I
      heard the rustle of a woman&rsquo;s dress. My situation was growing desperate,
      my suspicions were aroused&mdash;I determined to risk everything&mdash;and
      I called softly in the direction of the open door, &ldquo;Alicia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice answered, &ldquo;Good heavens! Frank?&rdquo; It was <i>her</i> voice. She had
      recognized mine. I pushed past the big servant; in two steps I was at the
      end of the passage; in one more I was in the back parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was there, standing alone by the side of a table. Seeing my changed
      costume and altered face, she turned deadly pale, and stretched her hand
      behind her mechanically, as if to take hold of a chair. I caught her in my
      arms; but I was afraid to kiss her&mdash;she trembled so when I only
      touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank!&rdquo; she said, drawing her head back. &ldquo;What is it? How did you find
      out? For mercy&rsquo;s sake what does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means, love, that I&rsquo;ve come to take care of you for the rest of your
      life and mine, if you will only let me. Don&rsquo;t tremble&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      nothing to be afraid of! Only compose yourself, and I&rsquo;ll tell you why I am
      here in this strange disguise. Come, come, Alicia!&mdash;don&rsquo;t look like
      that at me. You called me Frank just now, for the first time. Would you
      have done that, if you had disliked me or forgotten me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw her color beginning to come back&mdash;the old bright glow returning
      to the dear dusky cheeks. If I had not seen them so near me, I might have
      exercised some self-control&mdash;as it was, I lost my presence of mind
      entirely, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself away half-frightened, half-confused&mdash;certainly not
      offended, and, apparently, not very likely to faint&mdash;which was more
      than I could have said of her when I first entered the room. Before she
      had time to reflect on the peril and awkwardness of our position, I
      pressed the first necessary questions on her rapidly, one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Baggs?&rdquo; I asked first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baggs was the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alicia pointed to the closed folding-doors. &ldquo;In the front parlor; asleep
      on the sofa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any suspicion who the stranger was who called more than an hour
      ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. The servant told him we saw no visitors, and he went away, without
      leaving his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard from your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to turn pale again, but controlled herself bravely, and answered
      in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Baggs had a short note from him this morning. It was not dated; and
      it only said circumstances had happened which obliged him to leave home
      suddenly, and that we were to wait here till be wrote again, most likely
      in a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Alicia,&rdquo; I said, as lightly as I could, &ldquo;I have the highest possible
      opinion of your courage, good-sense, and self-control; and I shall expect
      you to keep up your reputation in my eyes, while you are listening to what
      I have to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words, I took her by the hand and made her sit close by me;
      then, breaking it to her as gently and gradually as possible, I told her
      all that had happened at the red-brick house since the evening when she
      left the dinner-table, and we exchanged our parting look at the
      dining-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost as great a trial to me to speak as it was to her to hear.
      She suffered so violently, felt such evident misery of shame and terror,
      while I was relating the strange events which had occurred in her absence,
      that I once or twice stopped in alarm, and almost repented my boldness in
      telling her the truth. However, fair-dealing with her, cruel as it might
      seem at the time, was the best and safest course for the future. How could
      I expect her to put all her trust in me if I began by deceiving her&mdash;if
      I fell into prevarications and excuses at the very outset of our renewal
      of intercourse? I went on desperately to the end, taking a hopeful view of
      the most hopeless circumstances, and making my narrative as mercifully
      short as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had done, the poor girl, in the extremity of her forlornness and
      distress, forgot all the little maidenly conventionalities and
      young-lady-like restraints of everyday life&mdash;and, in a burst of
      natural grief and honest confiding helplessness, hid her face on my bosom,
      and cried there as if she were a child again, and I was the mother to whom
      she had been used to look for comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no attempt to stop her tears&mdash;they were the safest and best
      vent for the violent agitation under which she was suffering. I said
      nothing; words, at such a ti me as that, would only have aggravated her
      distress. All the questions I had to ask; all the proposals I had to make,
      must, I felt, be put off&mdash;no matter at what risk&mdash;until some
      later and calmer hour. There we sat together, with one long unsnuffed
      candle lighting us smokily; with the discordantly-grotesque sound of the
      housekeeper&rsquo;s snoring in the front room, mingling with the sobs of the
      weeping girl on my bosom. No other noise, great or small, inside the house
      or out of it, was audible. The summer night looked black and cloudy
      through the little back window.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not much easier in my mind, now that the trial of breaking my bad
      news to Alicia was over. That stranger who had called at the house an hour
      before me, weighed on my spirits. It could not have been Doctor Dulcifer.
      He would have gained admission. Could it be the Bow Street runner, or
      Screw? I had lost sight of them, it is true; but had they lost sight of
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alicia&rsquo;s grief gradually exhausted itself. She feebly raised her head,
      and, turning it away from me, hid her face. I saw that she was not fit for
      talking yet, and begged her to go upstairs to the drawing-room and lie
      down a little. She looked apprehensively toward the folding-doors that
      shut us off from the front parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Mrs. Baggs to me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I want to have a few words with her;
      and, as soon as you are gone, I&rsquo;ll make noise enough here to wake her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alicia looked at me inquiringly and amazedly. I did not speak again. Time
      was now of terrible importance to us&mdash;I gently led her to the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as I was alone, I took from my pocket one of the handbills which
      my excitable fellow-traveler had presented to me, so as to have it ready
      for Mrs. Baggs the moment we stood face to face. Armed with this ominous
      letter of introduction, I kicked a chair down against the folding-doors,
      by way of giving a preliminary knock to arouse the housekeeper&rsquo;s
      attention. The plan was immediately successful. Mrs. Baggs opened the
      doors of communication violently. A slight smell of spirits entered the
      room, and was followed close by the housekeeper herself, with an indignant
      face and a disordered head-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, sir? How dare you&mdash;&rdquo; she began; then stopped
      aghast, looking at me in speechless astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been obliged to make a slight alteration in my personal
      appearance, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I am still Frank Softly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about personal appearances, sir,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Baggs
      recovering. &ldquo;What do you mean by being here? Leave the house immediately.
      I shall write to the doctor, Mr. Softly, this very night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no address you can direct to,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe
      me, read that.&rdquo; I gave her the handbill without another word of preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baggs looked at it&mdash;lost in an instant some of the fine color
      plentifully diffused over her face by sleep and spirits&mdash;sat down in
      the nearest chair with a thump that seemed to threaten the very
      foundations of Number Two, Zion Place&mdash;and stared me hard in the
      face; the most speechless and helpless elderly female I ever beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take plenty of time to compose yourself ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t see
      the doctor again soon, under the gallows, you will probably not have the
      pleasure of meeting with him for some considerable time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baggs smote both her hands distractedly on her knees, and whispered a
      devout ejaculation to herself softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to deal with you, ma&rsquo;am, as a woman of the world,&rdquo; I went on.
      &ldquo;If you will give me half-an-hour&rsquo;s hearing, I will explain to you how I
      come to know what I do; how I got here; and what I have to propose to Miss
      Alicia and to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have the feelings of a man, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baggs, shaking her
      head and raising her eyes to heaven, &ldquo;you will remember that I have
      nerves, and will not presume upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the old lady uttered the last words, I thought I saw her eyes turn from
      heaven, and take the earthly direction of the sofa in the front parlor. It
      struck me also that her lips looked rather dry. Upon these two hints I
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I suggest some little stimulant?&rdquo; I asked, with respectful
      earnestness. &ldquo;I have heard my grandmother (Lady Malkinshaw) say that, &lsquo;a
      drop in time saves nine.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find it under the sofa pillow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baggs, with sudden
      briskness. &ldquo;&lsquo;A drop in time saves nine&rsquo;&mdash;my sentiments, if I may put
      myself on a par with her ladyship. The liqueur-glass, Mr. Softly, is in
      the backgammon-board. I hope her ladyship was well the last time you heard
      from her? Suffers from her nerves, does she? Like me, again. In the
      backgammon-board. Oh, this news, this awful news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found the bottle of brandy in the place indicated, but no liqueur-glass
      in the backgammon-board. There was, however, a wine-glass, accidentally
      left on a chair by the sofa. Mrs. Baggs did not seem to notice the
      difference when I brought it into the back room and filled it with brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a toothful yourself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baggs, lightly tossing off the dram
      in a moment. &ldquo;&lsquo;A drop in time&rsquo;&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help repeating it, it&rsquo;s so
      nicely expressed. Still, with submission to her ladyship&rsquo;s better
      judgment, Mr. Softly, the question seems now to arise, whether, if one
      drop in time saves nine, two drops in time may not save eighteen.&rdquo; Here
      Mrs. Baggs forgot her nerves and winked. I returned the wink and filled
      the glass a second time. &ldquo;Oh, this news, this awful news!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Baggs, remembering her nerves again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then I thought I heard footsteps in front of the house, but,
      listening more attentively, found that it had begun to rain, and that I
      had been deceived by the pattering of the first heavy drops against the
      windows. However, the bare suspicion that the same stranger who had called
      already might be watching the house now, was enough to startle me very
      seriously, and to suggest the absolute necessity of occupying no more
      precious time in paying attention to the vagaries of Mrs. Baggs&rsquo; nerves.
      It was also of some importance that I should speak to her while she was
      sober enough to understand what I meant in a general way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling convinced that she was in imminent danger of becoming downright
      drunk if I gave her another glass, I kept my hand on the bottle, and
      forthwith told my story over again in a very abridged and unceremonious
      form, and without allowing her one moment of leisure for comment on my
      narrative, whether it might be of the weeping, winking, drinking,
      groaning, or ejaculating kind. As I had anticipated, when I came to a
      conclusion, and consequently allowed her an opportunity of saying a few
      words, she affected to be extremely shocked and surprised at hearing of
      the nature of her master&rsquo;s pursuits, and reproached me in terms of the
      most vehement and virtuous indignation for incurring the guilt of abetting
      them, even though I had done so from the very excusable motive of saving
      my own life. Having a lively sense of the humorous, I was necessarily
      rather amused by this; but I began to get a little surprised as well, when
      we diverged to the subject of the doctor&rsquo;s escape, on finding that Mrs.
      Baggs viewed the fact of his running away to some hiding-place of his own
      in the light of a personal insult to his faithful and attached
      housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shows a want of confidence in me,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;which I may
      forgive, but can never forget. The sacrifices I have made for that
      ungrateful man are not to be told in words. The very morning he sent us
      away here, what did I do? Packed up the moment he said Go. I had my
      preserves to pot, and the kitchen chimney to be swept, and the lock of my
      box hampered into the bargain. Other women in my place would have grumbled&mdash;I
      got up directly, as lively as any girl of eighteen you like to mention.
      Says he, &lsquo;I want Alicia taken out of young Softly&rsquo;s way, and you must do
      it.&rsquo;&mdash;-Says I, &lsquo;This very morning, sir?&rsquo;&mdash;Says he, &lsquo;This very
      morning.&rsquo;&mdash;Says I, &lsquo;Where to?&rsquo;&mdash;Says he, &lsquo;As far off as ever you
      can go; coast of Wales&mdash;Crickgelly. I won&rsquo;t trust her nearer; young
      Softly&rsquo;s too cunning, and she&rsquo;s too fond of him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Any more orders,
      sir?&rsquo; says I.&mdash;&lsquo;Yes; take some fancy name&mdash;Simkins, Johnson,
      Giles, Jones, James,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;what you like bu t Dulcifer; for that
      scamp Softly will move heaven and earth to trace her.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What else?&rsquo; 
      says I.&mdash;&lsquo;Nothing, but look sharp,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;and mind one thing,
      that she sees no visitors, and posts no letters.&rsquo; Before those last words
      had been out of his wicked lips an hour, we were off. A nice job I had to
      get her away&mdash;a nice job to stop her from writing letters to you&mdash;a
      nice job to keep her here. But I did it; I followed my orders like a slave
      in a plantation with a whip at his bare back. I&rsquo;ve had rheumatics, weak
      legs, bad nights, and miss in the sulks&mdash;all from obeying the
      doctor&rsquo;s orders. And what is my reward? He turns coiner, and runs away
      without a word to me beforehand, and writes me a trumpery note, without a
      date to it, without a farthing of money in it, telling me nothing! Look at
      my confidence in him, and then look at the way he&rsquo;s treated me in return.
      What woman&rsquo;s nerves can stand that? Don&rsquo;t keep fidgeting with the bottle!
      Pass it this way, Mr. Softly, or you&rsquo;ll break it, and drive me
      distracted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no excuse, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But will you allow me to change the
      subject, as I am pressed for time? You appear to be so well acquainted
      with the favorable opinion which Miss Alicia and I entertain of each
      other, that I hope it will be no fresh shock to your nerves, if I inform
      you, in plain words, that I have come to Crickgelly to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry her! marry&mdash;If you don&rsquo;t leave off fidgeting with the bottle,
      Mr. Softly, and change the subject directly, I shall ring the bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me out, ma&rsquo;am, and then ring if you like. If you persist, however,
      in considering yourself still the confidential servant of a felon who is
      now flying for his life, and if you decline allowing the young lady to act
      as she wishes, I will not be so rude as to hint that&mdash;as she is of
      age&mdash;she may walk out of this house with me, whenever she likes,
      without your having the power to prevent her; but, I will politely ask
      instead, what you would propose to do with her, in the straitened position
      as to money in which she and you are likely to be placed? You can&rsquo;t find
      her father to give her to; and, if you could, who would be the best
      protector for her? The doctor, who is the principal criminal in the eye of
      the law, or I, who am only the unwilling accomplice? He is known to the
      Bow Street runners&mdash;I am not. There is a reward for the taking of
      him, and none for the taking of me. He has no respectable relatives and
      friends, I have plenty. Every way my chances are the best; and
      consequently I am, every way, the fittest person to trust her to. Don&rsquo;t
      you see that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baggs did not immediately answer. She snatched the bottle out of my
      hands&mdash;drank off another dram, shook her head at me, and ejaculated
      lamentably: &ldquo;My nerves, my nerves! what a heart of stone he must have to
      presume on my poor nerves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me one minute more,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;I propose to take you and Alicia
      to-morrow morning to Scotland. Pray don&rsquo;t groan! I only suggest the
      journey with a matrimonial object. In Scotland, Mrs. Baggs, if a man and
      woman accept each other as husband and wife, before one witness, it is a
      lawful marriage; and that kind of wedding is, as you see plainly enough,
      the only safe refuge for a bridegroom in my situation. If you consent to
      come with us to Scotland, and serve as witness to the marriage, I shall be
      delighted to acknowledge my sense of your kindness in the eloquent
      language of the Bank of England, as expressed to the world in general on
      the surface of a five-pound note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I cautiously snatched away the brandy bottle as I spoke, and was in the
      drawing-room with it in an instant. As I suppose, Mrs. Baggs tried to
      follow me, for I heard the door rattle, as if she had got out of her
      chair, and suddenly slipped back into it again. I felt certain of her
      deciding to help us, if she was only sober enough to reflect on what I had
      said to her. The journey to Scotland was a tedious, and perhaps a
      dangerous, undertaking. But I had no other alternative to choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those uncivilized days, the Marriage Act had not been passed, and there
      was no convenient hymeneal registrar in England to change a vagabond
      runaway couple into a respectable man and wife at a moment&rsquo;s notice. The
      trouble and expense of taking Mrs. Baggs with us, I encountered, of
      course, solely out of regard for Alicia&rsquo;s natural prejudices. She had led
      precisely that kind of life which makes any woman but a bad one morbidly
      sensitive on the subject of small proprieties. If she had been a girl with
      a recognized position in society, I should have proposed to her to run
      away with me alone. As it was, the very defenselessness of her situation
      gave her, in my opinion, the right to expect from me even the absurdest
      sacrifices to the narrowest conventionalities. Mrs. Baggs was not quite so
      sober in her habits, perhaps, as matrons in general are expected to be;
      but, for my particular purpose, this was only a slight blemish; it takes
      so little, after all, to represent the abstract principle of propriety in
      the short-sighted eye of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I reached the drawing-room door, I looked at my watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine o&rsquo;clock! and nothing done yet to facilitate our escaping from
      Crickgelly to the regions of civilized life the next morning. I was
      pleased to hear, when I knocked at the door, that Alicia&rsquo;s voice sounded
      firmer as she told me to come in. She was more confused than astonished or
      frightened when I sat down by her on the sofa, and repeated the principal
      topics of my conversion with Mrs. Baggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my own love,&rdquo; I said, in conclusion&mdash;suiting my gestures, it is
      unnecessary to say, to the tenderness of my language&mdash;&ldquo;there is not
      the least doubt that Mrs. Baggs will end by agreeing to my proposals.
      Nothing remains, therefore, but for you to give me the answer now, which I
      have been waiting for ever since that last day when we met by the
      riverside. I did not know then what the motive was for your silence and
      distress. I know now, and I love you better after that knowledge than I
      did before it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head dropped into its former position on my bosom, and she murmured a
      few words, but too faintly for me to hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew more about your father, then, than I did?&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less than you have told me since,&rdquo; she interposed quickly, without
      raising her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to convince you that he was breaking the laws,&rdquo; I suggested; &ldquo;and,
      to make you, as his daughter, shrink from saying &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to me when we sat
      together on the river bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. One of her arms, which was hanging over my shoulder,
      stole round my neck, and clasped it gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that time,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;your father has compromised me. I am in
      some danger, not much, from the law. I have no prospects that are not of
      the most doubtful kind; and I have no excuse for asking you to share them,
      except that I have fallen into my present misfortune through trying to
      discover the obstacle that kept us apart. If there is any protection in
      the world that you can turn to, less doubtful than mine, I suppose I ought
      to say no more, and leave the house. But if there should be none, surely I
      am not so very selfish in asking you to take your chance with me? I
      honestly believe that I shall have little difficulty, with ordinary
      caution, in escaping from pursuit, and finding a safe home somewhere to
      begin life in again with new interests. Will you share it with me, Alicia?
      I can try no fresh persuasions&mdash;-I have no right, perhaps, in my
      present situation to have addressed so many to you already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her other arm stole round my neck; she laid her cheek against mine, and
      whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be kind to me, Frank&mdash;I have nobody in the world who loves me but
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt her tears on my face; my own eyes moistened as I tried to answer
      her. We sat for some minutes in perfect silence&mdash;without moving,
      without a thought beyond the moment. The rising of the wind, and the
      splashing of the rain outside were the first sounds that stirred me into
      action again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I summoned my resolution, rose from the sofa, and in a few hasty words
      told Alicia what I proposed for the next day, and mentioned the hour at
      which I would come in the morning. As I had anticipated, she seemed
      relieved and reassured at the prospect even of such slight sanction and
      encouragement, on the part of another woman, as would be implied by the
      companionship of Mrs. Baggs on the journey to Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next and last difficulty I had to encounter was necessarily connected
      with her father. He had never been very affectionate; and he was now, for
      aught she or I knew to the contrary, parted from her forever. Still, the
      instinctive recognition of his position made her shrink, at the last
      moment, when she spoke of him, and thought of the serious nature of her
      engagement with me. After some vain arguing and remonstrating, I contrived
      to quiet her scruples, by promising that an address should be left at
      Crickgelly, to which any second letter that might arrive from the doctor
      could be forwarded. When I saw that this prospect of being able to
      communicate with him, if he wrote or wished to see her, had sufficiently
      composed her mind, I left the drawing-room. It was vitally important that
      I should get back to the inn and make the necessary arrangements for our
      departure the next morning, before the primitive people of the place had
      retired to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed the back parlor door on my way out, I heard the voice of Mrs.
      Baggs raised indignantly. The words &ldquo;bottle!&rdquo; &ldquo;audacity!&rdquo; and &ldquo;nerves!&rdquo;
       reached my ear disjointedly. I called out &ldquo;Good-by! till to-morrow;&rdquo; heard
      a responsive groan of disgust; then opened the front door, and plunged out
      into the dark and rainy night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been the dropping of water from the cottage roofs while I
      passed through the village, or the groundless alarm of my own suspicious
      fancy, but I thought I was being followed as I walked back to the inn. Two
      or three times I turned round abruptly. If twenty men had been at my
      heels, it was too dark to see them. I went on to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people there were not gone to bed; and I sent for the landlord to
      consult with him about a conveyance. Perhaps it was my suspicious fancy
      again; but I thought his manner was altered. He seemed half distrustful,
      half afraid of me, when I asked him if there had been any signs, during my
      absence, of those two gentlemen, for whom I had already inquired on
      arriving at his door that evening. He gave an answer in the negative,
      looking away from me while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking it advisable, on the whole, not to let him see that I noticed a
      change in him, I proceeded at once to the question of the conveyance, and
      was told that I could hire the landlord&rsquo;s light cart, in which he was
      accustomed to drive to the market town. I appointed an hour for starting
      the next day, and retired at once to my bedroom. There my thoughts were
      enough. I was anxious about Screw and the Bow Street runner. I was
      uncertain about the stranger who had called at Number Two, Zion Place. I
      was in doubt even about the landlord of the inn. Never did I know what
      real suffering from suspense was, until that night, Whatever my
      apprehensions might have been, they were none of them realized the next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody followed me on my way to Zion Place, and no stranger had called
      there before me a second time, when I made inquiries on entering the
      house. I found Alicia blushing, and Mrs. Baggs impenetrably wrapped up in
      dignified sulkiness. After informing me with a lofty look that she
      intended to go to Scotland with us, and to take my five-pound note&mdash;partly
      under protest, and partly out of excessive affection for Alicia&mdash;she
      retired to pack up. The time consumed in performing this process, and the
      further delay occasioned by paying small outstanding debts to
      tradespeople, and settling with the owner of the house, detained us till
      nearly noon before we were ready to get into the landlord&rsquo;s cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked behind me anxiously at starting, and often afterward on the road;
      but never saw anything to excite my suspicions. In settling matters with
      the landlord over night, I had arranged that we should be driven to the
      nearest town at which a post-chaise could be obtained. My resources were
      just as likely to hold out against the expenses of posting, where public
      conveyances could not be obtained, as against the expense of waiting
      privately at hotels, until the right coaches might start. According to my
      calculations, my money would last till we got to Scotland. After that, I
      had my watch, rings, shirtpin, and Mr. Batterbury, to help in replenishing
      my purse. Anxious, therefore, as I was about other things, money matters,
      for once in a way, did not cause me the smallest uneasiness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE posted five-and-thirty miles, then stopped for a couple of hours to
      rest, and wait for a night coach running northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      On getting into this vehicle we were fortunate enough to find the fourth
      inside place not occupied. Mrs. Baggs showed her sense of the freedom from
      restraint thus obtained by tying a huge red comforter round her head like
      a turban, and immediately falling fast asleep. This gave Alicia and me
      full liberty to talk as we pleased. Our conversation was for the most part
      of that particular kind which is not of the smallest importance to any
      third person in the whole world. One portion of it, however, was an
      exception to this general rule. It had a very positive influence on my
      fortunes, and it is, therefore, I hope, of sufficient importance to bear
      being communicated to the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had changed horses for the fourth time, had seated ourselves
      comfortably in our places, and had heard Mrs. Baggs resume the kindred
      occupations of sleeping and snoring, when Alicia whispered to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have no secrets, now, from you&mdash;must I, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have anything you like, do anything you like, and say anything
      you like. You must never ask leave&mdash;but only grant it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you always tell me that, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not answer in words, but the conversation suffered a momentary
      interruption. Of what nature, susceptible people will easily imagine. As
      for the hard-hearted I don&rsquo;t write for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My secret need not alarm you,&rdquo; Alicia went on, in tones that began to
      sound rather sadly; &ldquo;it is only about a tiny pasteboard box that I can
      carry in the bosom of my dress. But it has got three diamonds in it,
      Frank, and one beautiful ruby. Did you ever give me credit for having so
      much that was valuable about me?&mdash;shall I give it you to keep for
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered directly Old File&rsquo;s story of Mrs. Dulcifer&rsquo;s elopement, and
      of the jewels she had taken with her. It was easy to guess, after what I
      had heard, that the poor woman had secretly preserved some of her little
      property for the benefit of her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no present need of money, darling,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;keep the box in
      its present enviable position.&rdquo; I stopped there, saying nothing of the
      thought that was really uppermost in my mind. If any unforeseen accident
      placed me within the grip of the law, I should not now have the double
      trial to endure of leaving my wife for a prison, and leaving her helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning dawned and found us still awake. The sun rose, Mrs. Baggs left off
      snoring, and we arrived at the last stage before the coach stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got out to see about some tea for my traveling companions, and looked up
      at the outside passengers. One of them seated in the dickey looked down at
      me. He was a countryman in a smock-frock, with a green patch over one of
      his eyes. Something in the expression of his uncovered eye made me pause&mdash;reflect&mdash;turn
      away uneasily&mdash;and then look again at him furtively. A sudden shudder
      ran through me from top to toe; my heart sank; and my head began to feel
      giddy. The countryman in the dickey was no other than the Bow Street
      runner in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept away from the coach till the fresh horses were on the point of
      starting, for I was afraid to let Alicia see my face, after making that
      fatal discovery. She noticed how pale I was when I got in. I made the best
      excuse I could; and gently insisted on her trying to sleep a little after
      being awake all night. She lay back in her corner; and Mrs. Baggs,
      comforted with a morning dram in her tea, fell asleep again. I had thus an
      hour&rsquo;s leisure before me to think what I should do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Screw was not in company with the runner this time. He must have managed
      to identify me somewhere, and the officer doubtless knew my personal
      appearance well enough now to follow and make sure of me without help.
      That I was the man whom he was tracking could not be doubted: his disguise
      and his position on the top of the coach proved it only too plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why had he not seized me at once? Probably because he had some
      ulterior purpose to serve, which would have been thwarted by my immediate
      apprehension. What that purpose was I did my best to fathom, and, as I
      thought, succeeded in the attempt. What I was to do when the coach stopped
      was a more difficult point to settle. To give the runner the slip, with
      two women to take care of, was simply impossible. To treat him, as I had
      treated Screw at the red-brick house, was equally out of the question, for
      he was certain to give me no chance of catching him alone. To keep him in
      ignorance of the real object of my journey, and thereby to delay his
      discovering himself and attempting to make me a prisoner, seemed the only
      plan on the safety of which I could place the smallest reliance. If I had
      ever had any idea of following the example of other runaway lovers, and
      going to Gretna Green, I should now have abandoned it. All roads in that
      direction would betray what the purpose of my journey was if I took them.
      Some large town in Scotland would be the safest destination that I could
      publicly advertise myself as bound for. Why not boldly say that I was
      going with the two ladies to Edinburgh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the plan of action which I now adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give any idea of the distracted condition of my mind at the time when I
      was forming it, is simply impossible. As for doubting whether I ought to
      marry at all under these dangerous circumstances, I must frankly own that
      I was too selfishly and violently in love to look the question fairly in
      the face at first. When I subsequently forced myself to consider it, the
      most distinct project I could frame for overcoming all difficulty was, to
      marry myself (the phrase is strictly descriptive of the Scotch ceremony)
      at the first inn we came to, over the Border; to hire a chaise, or take
      places in a public conveyance to Edinburgh, as a blind; to let Alicia and
      Mrs. Baggs occupy those places; to remain behind myself; and to trust to
      my audacity and cunning, when left alone, to give the runner the slip.
      Writing of it now, in cool blood, this seems as wild and hopeless a plan
      as ever was imagined. But, in the confused and distracted state of all my
      faculties at that period, it seemed quite easy to execute, and not in the
      least doubtful as to any one of its probable results.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the town at which the coach stopped, we found ourselves
      obliged to hire another chaise for a short distance, in order to get to
      the starting-point of a second coach. Again we took inside places, and
      again, at the first stages when I got down to look at the outside
      passengers, there was the countryman with the green shade over his eye.
      Whatever conveyance we traveled by on our northward road, we never escaped
      him. He never attempted to speak to me, never seemed to notice me, and
      never lost sight of me. On and on we went, over roads that seemed
      interminable, and still the dreadful sword of justice hung always, by its
      single hair, over my head. My haggard face, my feverish hands, my confused
      manner, my inexpressible impatience, all belied the excuses with which I
      desperately continued to ward off Alicia&rsquo;s growing fears, and Mrs. Baggs&rsquo;s
      indignant suspicions. &ldquo;Oh! Frank, something has happened! For God&rsquo;s sake,
      tell me what!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Softly, I can see through a deal board as far as
      most people. You are following the doctor&rsquo;s wicked example, and showing a
      want of confidence in me.&rdquo; These were the remonstrances of Alicia and the
      housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we got out of England, and I was still a free man. The chaise (we
      were posting again) brought us into a dirty town, and drew up at the door
      of a shabby inn. A shock-headed girl received us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we in Scotland?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon! whar&rsquo; else should ye be?&rdquo; The accent relieved me of all doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A private room&mdash;something to eat, ready in an hour&rsquo;s time&mdash;chaise
      afterward to the nearest place from which a coach runs to Edinburgh.&rdquo;
       Giving these orders rapidly, I followed the girl with my traveling
      companions into a stuffy little room. As soon as our attendant had left
      us, I locked the door, put the key in my pocket, and took Alicia by the
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Baggs,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;bear witness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to marry her now!&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Baggs, indignantly.
      &ldquo;Bear witness, indeed! I won&rsquo;t bear witness till I&rsquo;ve taken off my bonnet,
      and put my hair tidy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ceremony won&rsquo;t take a minute,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll give you your
      five-pound note and open the door the moment it&rsquo;s over. Bear witness,&rdquo; I
      went on, drowning Mrs. Baggs&rsquo;s expostulations with the all-important
      marriage-words, &ldquo;that I take this woman, Alicia Dulcifer for my lawful
      wedded wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sickness and in health, in poverty and wealth,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Baggs,
      determining to represent the clergyman as well as to be the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alicia, dear,&rdquo; I said, interrupting in my turn, &ldquo;repeat my words. Say &lsquo;I
      take this man, Francis Softly, for my lawful wedded husband.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She repeated the sentence, with her face very pale, with her dear hand
      cold and trembling in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For better for worse,&rdquo; continued the indomitable Mrs. Baggs. &ldquo;Little
      enough of the Better, I&rsquo;m afraid, and Lord knows how much of the Worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped her again with the promised five-pound note, and opened the room
      door. &ldquo;Now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;go to your room; take off your bonnet, and
      put your hair as tidy as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baggs raised her eyes and hands to heaven, exclaimed &ldquo;Disgraceful!&rdquo;
       and flounced out of the room in a passion. Such was my Scotch marriage&mdash;as
      lawful a ceremony, remember, as the finest family wedding at the largest
      parish church in all England.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed; and I had not yet summoned the cruel courage to
      communicate my real situation to Alicia. The entry of the shock-headed
      servant-girl to lay the cloth, followed by Mrs. Baggs, who was never out
      of the way where eating and drinking appeared in prospect, helped me to
      rouse myself. I resolved to go out for a few minutes to reconnoiter, and
      make myself acquainted with any facilities for flight or hiding which the
      situation of the house might present. No doubt the Bow Street runner was
      lurking somewhere; but he must, as a matter of course, have heard, or
      informed himself, of the orders I had given relating to our conveyance on
      to Edinburgh; and, in that case, I was still no more in danger of his
      avowing himself and capturing me, than I had been at any previous period
      of our journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going out for a moment, love, to see about the chaise,&rdquo; I said to
      Alicia. She suddenly looked up at me with an anxious searching expression.
      Was my face betraying anything of my real purpose? I hurried to the door
      before she could ask me a single question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front of the inn stood nearly in the middle of the principal street of
      the town. No chance of giving any one the slip in that direction; and no
      sign, either, of the Bow Street runner. I sauntered round, with the most
      unconcerned manner I could assume, to the back of the house, by the inn
      yard. A door in one part of it stood half-open. Inside was a bit of
      kitchen-garden, bounded by a paling; beyond that some backs of detached
      houses; beyond them, again, a plot of weedy ground, a few wretched
      cottages, and the open, heathery moor. Good enough for running away, but
      terribly bad for hiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned disconsolately to the inn. Walking along the passage toward the
      staircase, I suddenly heard footsteps behind me&mdash;turned round, and
      saw the Bow Street runner (clothed again in his ordinary costume, and
      accompanied by two strange men) standing between me and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to stop you from going to Edinburgh, Mr. Softly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
      you&rsquo;re wanted back at Barkingham. I&rsquo;ve just found out what you have been
      traveling all the way to Scotland for; and I take you prisoner, as one of
      the coining gang. Take it easy, sir. I&rsquo;ve got help, you see; and you can&rsquo;t
      throttle three men, whatever you may have done at Barkingham with one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handcuffed me as he spoke. Resistance was hopeless. I could only make
      an appeal to his mercy, on Alicia&rsquo;s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me ten minutes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to break what has happened to my wife. We
      were only married an hour ago. If she knows this suddenly, it may be the
      death of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve led me a nice dance on a wrong scent,&rdquo; answered the runner,
      sulkily. &ldquo;But I never was a hard man where women are concerned. Go
      upstairs, and leave the door open, so that I can see in through it if I
      like. Hold your hat over your wrists, if you don&rsquo;t want her to see the
      handcuffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ascended the first flight of stairs, and my heart gave a sudden bound as
      if it would burst. I stopped, speechless and helpless, at the sight of
      Alicia, standing alone on the landing. My first look at her face told me
      she had heard all that had passed in the passage. She passionately struck
      the hat with which I had been trying to hide the handcuffs out of my
      fingers, and clasped me in her arms with such sudden and desperate energy
      that she absolutely hurt me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid of something, Frank,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I followed you a
      little way. I stopped here; I have heard everything. Don&rsquo;t let us be
      parted! I am stronger than you think me. I won&rsquo;t be frightened. I won&rsquo;t
      cry. I won&rsquo;t trouble anybody, if that man will only take me with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is best for my sake, if not for the reader&rsquo;s, to hurry over the scene
      that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ended with as little additional wretchedness as could be expected. The
      runner was resolute about keeping me handcuffed, and taking me back,
      without a moment&rsquo;s unnecessary waste of time to Barkingham; but he
      relented on other points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where he was obliged to order a private conveyance, there was no objection
      to Alicia and Mrs. Baggs following it. Where we got into a coach, there
      was no harm in their hiring two inside places. I gave my watch, rings, and
      last guinea to Alicia, enjoining her, on no account, to let her box of
      jewels see the light until we could get proper advice on the best means of
      turning them to account. She listened to these and other directions with a
      calmness that astonished me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t say, my dear, that your wife has helped to make you uneasy by
      so much as a word or a look,&rdquo; she whispered to me as we left the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she kept the hard promise implied in that one short sentence
      throughout the journey. Once only did I see her lose her self-possession.
      At starting on our way south, Mrs. Baggs&mdash;taking the same
      incomprehensible personal offense at my misfortune which she had
      previously taken at the doctor&rsquo;s&mdash;upbraided me with my want of
      confidence in her, and declared that it was the main cause of all my
      present trouble. Alicia turned on her as she was uttering the words, with
      a look and a warning that silenced her in an instant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say another syllable that isn&rsquo;t kind to him, you shall find your
      way back by yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words may not seem of much importance to others; but I thought, as I
      overheard them, that they justified every sacrifice I had made for my
      wife&rsquo;s sake.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON our way back I received from the runner some explanation of his
      apparently unaccountable proceedings in reference to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin at the beginning, it turned out that the first act of the
      officers, on their release from the workroom in the red-brick house, was
      to institute a careful search for papers in the doctor&rsquo;s study and
      bedroom. Among the other documents that he had not had time to destroy,
      was a letter to him from Alicia, which they took from one of the pockets
      of his dressing-gown. Finding, from the report of the men who had followed
      the gig, that he had distanced all pursuit, and having therefore no direct
      clew to his whereabout, they had been obliged to hunt after him in various
      directions, on pure speculation. Alicia&rsquo;s letter to her father gave the
      address of the house at Crickgelly; and to this the runner repaired, on
      the chance of intercepting or discovering any communications which the
      doctor might make to his daughter, Screw being taken with the officer to
      identify the young lady. After leaving the last coach, they posted to
      within a mile of Crickgelly, and then walked into the village, in order to
      excite no special attention, should the doctor be lurking in the
      neighborhood. The runner had tried ineffectually to gain admission as a
      visitor at Zion Place. After having the door shut on him, he and Screw had
      watched the house and village, and had seen me approach Number Two. Their
      suspicions were directly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, Screw had not recognized, nor even observed me; but he
      immediately identified me by my voice, while I was parleying with the
      stupid servant at the door. The runner, hearing who I was, reasonably
      enough concluded that I must be the recognized medium of communication
      between the doctor and his daughter, especially when he found that I was
      admitted, instantly after calling, past the servant, to some one inside
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Screw on the watch, he went to the inn, discovered himself
      privately to the landlord, and made sure (in more ways than one, as I
      conjectured) of knowing when, and in what direction, I should leave
      Crickgelly. On finding that I was to leave it the next morning, with
      Alicia and Mrs. Baggs, he immediately suspected that I was charged with
      the duty of taking the daughter to, or near, the place chosen for the
      father&rsquo;s retreat; and had therefore abstained from interfering prematurely
      with my movements. Knowing whither we were bound in the cart, he had
      ridden after us, well out of sight, with his countryman&rsquo;s disguise ready
      for use in the saddle-bags&mdash;Screw, in case of any mistakes or
      mystifications, being left behind on the watch at Crickgelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibility that I might be running away with Alicia had suggested
      itself to him; but he dismissed it as improbable, first when he saw that
      Mrs. Baggs accompanied us, and again, when, on nearing Scotland, he found
      that we did not take the road to Gretna Green. He acknowledged, in
      conclusion, that he should have followed us to Edinburgh, or even to the
      Continent itself, on the chance of our leading him to the doctor&rsquo;s
      retreat, but for the servant girl at the inn, who had listened outside the
      door while our brief marriage ceremony was proceeding, and from whom, with
      great trouble and delay, he had extracted all the information he required.
      A further loss of half an hour&rsquo;s time had occurred while he was getting
      the necessary help to assist him, in the event of my resisting, or trying
      to give him the slip, in making me a prisoner. These small facts accounted
      for the hour&rsquo;s respite we had enjoyed at the inn, and terminated the
      runner&rsquo;s narrative of his own proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at our destination I was, of course, immediately taken to the
      jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alicia, by my advice, engaged a modest lodging in a suburb of Barkingham.
      In the days of the red-brick house, she had seldom been seen in the town,
      and she was not at all known by sight in the suburb. We arranged that she
      was to visit me as often as the authorities would let her. She had no
      companion, and wanted none. Mrs. Baggs, who had never forgiven the rebuke
      administered to her at the starting-point of our journey, left us at the
      close of it. Her leave-taking was dignified and pathetic. She kindly
      informed Alicia that she wished her well, though she could not
      conscientiously look upon her as a lawful married woman; and she begged me
      (in case I got off), the next time I met with a respectable person who was
      kind to me, to profit by remembering my past errors, and to treat my next
      benefactress with more confidence than I had treated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first business in the prison was to write to Mr. Batterbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a magnificent ease to present to him, this time. Although I believed
      myself, and had succeeded in persuading Alicia, that I was sure of being
      recommended to mercy, it was not the less the fact that I was charged with
      an offense still punishable by death, in the then barbarous state of the
      law. I delicately stated just enough of my case to make one thing clear to
      the mind of Mr. Batterbury. My affectionate sister&rsquo;s interest in the
      contingent reversion was now ( unless Lady Malkinshaw perversely and
      suddenly expired) actually threatened by the Gallows!
    </p>
    <p>
      While calmly awaiting the answer, I was by no means without subjects to
      occupy my attention when Alicia was not at the prison. There was my
      fellow-workman&mdash;Mill&mdash;(the first member of our society betrayed
      by Screw) to compare notes with; and there was a certain prisoner who had
      been transported, and who had some very important and interesting
      particulars to communicate, relative to life and its chances in our
      felon-settlements at the Antipodes. I talked a great deal with this man;
      for I felt that his experience might be of the greatest possible benefit
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Batterbury&rsquo;s answer was speedy, short, and punctual. I had shattered
      his nervous system forever, he wrote, but had only stimulated his devotion
      to my family, and his Christian readiness to look pityingly on my
      transgressions. He had engaged the leader of the circuit to defend me; and
      he would have come to see me, but for Mrs. Batterbury; who had implored
      him not to expose himself to agitation. Of Lady Malkinshaw the letter said
      nothing; but I afterward discovered that she was then at Cheltenham,
      drinking the waters and playing whist in the rudest health and spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a bold thing to say, but nothing will ever persuade me that Society
      has not a sneaking kindness for a Rogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, my father never had half the attention shown to him in his
      own house, which was shown to me in my prison. I have seen High Sheriffs
      in the great world, whom my father went to see, give him two fingers&mdash;the
      High Sheriff of Barkinghamshire came to see me, and shook hands cordially.
      Nobody ever wanted my father&rsquo;s autograph&mdash;dozens of people asked for
      mine. Nobody ever put my father&rsquo;s portrait in the frontispiece of a
      magazine, or described his personal appearance and manners with anxious
      elaboration, in the large type of a great newspaper&mdash;I enjoyed both
      those honors. Three official individuals politely begged me to be sure and
      make complaints if my position was not perfectly comfortable. No official
      individual ever troubled his head whether my father was comfortable or
      not. When the day of my trial came, the court was thronged by my lovely
      countrywomen, who stood up panting in the crowd and crushing their
      beautiful dresses, rather than miss the pleasure of seeing the dear Rogue
      in the dock. When my father once stood on the lecturer&rsquo;s rostrum, and
      delivered his excellent discourse, called &ldquo;Medical Hints to Maids and
      Mothers on Tight Lacing and Teething,&rdquo; the benches were left empty by the
      ungrateful women of England, who were not in the slightest degree anxious
      to feast their eyes on the sight of a learned adviser and respectable man.
      If these facts led to one inevitable conclusion, it is not my fault. We
      Rogues are the spoiled children of Society. We may not be openly
      acknowledged as Pets, but we all know, by pleasant experience, that we are
      treated like them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial was deeply affecting. My defense&mdash;or rather my barrister&rsquo;s&mdash;was
      the simple truth. It was impossible to overthrow the facts against us; so
      we honestly owned that I got into the scrape through love for Alicia. My
      counsel turned this to the best possible sentimental account. He cried;
      the ladies cried; the jury cried; the judge cried; and Mr. Batterbury, who
      had desperately come to see the trial, and know the worst, sobbed with
      such prominent vehemence, that I believe him, to this day, to have greatly
      influenced the verdict. I was strongly recommended to mercy and got off
      with fourteen years&rsquo; transportation. The unfortunate Mill, who was tried
      after me, with a mere dry-eyed barrister to defend him, was hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      POSTSCRIPT.
    </p>
    <p>
      WITH the record of my sentence of transportation, my life as a Rogue ends,
      and my existence as a respectable man begins. I am sorry to say anything
      which may disturb popular delusions on the subject of poetical justice,
      but this is strictly the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first anxiety was about my wife&rsquo;s future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Batterbury gave me no chance of asking his advice after the trial. The
      moment sentence had been pronounced, he allowed himself to be helped out
      of court in a melancholy state of prostration, and the next morning he
      left for London. I suspect he was afraid to face me, and nervously
      impatient, besides, to tell Annabella that he had saved the legacy again
      by another alarming sacrifice. My father and mother, to whom I had written
      on the subject of Alicia, were no more to be depended on than Mr.
      Batterbury. My father, in answering my letter, told me that he
      conscientiously believed he had done enough in forgiving me for throwing
      away an excellent education, and disgracing a respectable name. He added
      that he had not allowed my letter for my mother to reach her, out of
      pitying regard for her broken health and spirits; and he ended by telling
      me (what was perhaps very true) that the wife of such a son as I had been,
      had no claim upon her father-in-law&rsquo;s protection and help. There was an
      end, then, of any hope of finding resources for Alicia among the members
      of my own family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing was to discover a means of providing for her without
      assistance. I had formed a project for this, after meditating over my
      conversations with the returned transport in Barkingham jail, and I had
      taken a reliable opinion on the chances of successfully executing my
      design from the solicitor who had prepared my defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alicia herself was so earnestly in favor of assisting in my experiment,
      that she declared she would prefer death to its abandonment. Accordingly,
      the necessary preliminaries were arranged; and, when we parted, it was
      some mitigation of our grief to know that there was a time appointed for
      meeting again. Alicia was to lodge with a distant relative of her mother&rsquo;s
      in a suburb of London; was to concert measures with this relative on the
      best method of turning her jewels into money; and was to follow her
      convict husband to the Antipodes, under a feigned name, in six months&rsquo; 
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If my family had not abandoned me, I need not have thus left her to help
      herself. As it was, I had no choice. One consolation supported me at
      parting&mdash;she was in no danger of persecution from her father. A
      second letter from him had arrived at Crickgelly, and had been forwarded
      to the address I had left for it. It was dated Hamburg, and briefly told
      her to remain at Crickgelly, and expect fresh instructions, explanations,
      and a supply of money, as soon as he had settled the important business
      matters which had taken him abroad. His daughter answered the letter,
      telling him of her marriage, and giving him an address at a post-office to
      write to, if he chose to reply to her communication. There the matter
      rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was I to do on my side? Nothing but establish a reputation for mild
      behavior. I began to manufacture a character for myself for the first days
      of our voyage out in the convict-ship; and I landed at the penal
      settlement with the reputation of being the meekest and most biddable of
      felonious mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short probationary experience of such low convict employments as
      lime-burning and road-mending, I was advanced to occupations more in
      harmony with my education. Whatever I did, I never neglected the first
      great obligation of making myself agreeable and amusing to everybody. My
      social reputation as a good fellow began to stand as high at one end of
      the world as ever it stood at the other. The months passed more quickly
      than I had dared to hope. The expiration of my first year of
      transportation was approaching, and already pleasant hints of my being
      soon assigned to private service began to reach my ears. This was the
      first of the many ends I was now working for; and the next pleasant
      realization of my hopes that I had to expect, was the arrival of Alicia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, a month later than I had anticipated; safe and blooming, with
      five hundred pounds as the produce of her jewels, and with the old
      Crickgelly alias (changed from Miss to Mrs. Giles), to prevent any
      suspicions of the connection between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her story (concocted by me before I left England) was, that she was a
      widow lady, who had come to settle in Australia, and make the most of her
      little property in the New World. One of the first things Mrs. Giles
      wanted was necessarily a trustworthy servant, and she had to make her
      choice of one among the convicts of good character, to be assigned to
      private service. Being one of that honorable body myself at the time, it
      is needless to say that I was the fortunate man on whom Mrs. Giles&rsquo;s
      choice fell. The first situation I got in Australia was as servant to my
      own wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alicia made a very indulgent mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had been mischievously inclined, she might, by application to a
      magistrate, have had me flogged or set to work in chains on the roads,
      whenever I became idle or insubordinate, which happened occasionally. But
      instead of complaining, the kind creature kissed and made much of her
      footman by stealth, after his day&rsquo;s work. She allowed him no female
      followers, and only employed one woman-servant occasionally, who was both
      old and ugly. The name of the footman was Dear in private, and Francis in
      company; and when the widowed mistress, upstairs, refused eligible offers
      of marriage (which was pretty often), the favored domestic in the kitchen
      was always informed of it, and asked, with the sweetest humility, if he
      approved of the proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to dwell on this anomalous period of my existence, let me say briefly
      that my new position with my wife was of the greatest advantage in
      enabling me to direct in secret the profitable uses to which her little
      fortune was put.
    </p>
    <p>
      We began in this way with an excellent speculation in cattle&mdash;buying
      them for shillings and selling them for pounds. With the profits thus
      obtained, we next tried our hands at houses&mdash;first buying in a small
      way, then boldly building, and letting again and selling to great
      advantage. While these speculations were in progress, my behavior in my
      wife&rsquo;s service was so exemplary, and she gave me so excellent a character
      when the usual official inquiries were instituted, that I soon got the
      next privilege accorded to persons in my situation&mdash;a
      ticket-of-leave. By the time this had been again exchanged for a
      conditional pardon (which allowed me to go about where I pleased in
      Australia, and to trade in my own name like any unconvicted merchant) our
      house-property had increased enormously, our land had been sold for public
      buildings, and we had shares in the famous Emancipist&rsquo;s Bank, which
      produced quite a little income of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now no need to keep the mask on any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went through the superfluous ceremony of a second marriage with Alicia;
      took stores in the city; built a villa in the country; and here I am at
      this present moment of writing, a convict aristocrat&mdash;a prosperous,
      wealthy, highly respectable mercantile man, with two years of my sentence
      of transportation still to expire. I have a barouche and two bay horses, a
      coachman and page in neat liveries, three charming children, and a French
      governess, a boudoir and lady&rsquo;s-maid for my wife. She is as handsome as
      ever, but getting a little fat. So am I, as a worthy friend remarked when
      I recently appeared holding the plate, at our last charity sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would my surviving relatives and associates in England say, if they
      could see me now? I have heard of them at different times and through
      various channels. Lady Malkinshaw, after living to the verge of a hundred,
      and surviving all sorts of accidents, died quietly one afternoon, in her
      chair, with an empty dish before her, and without giving the slightest
      notice to anybody. Mr. Batterbury, having sacrificed so much to his wife&rsquo;s
      reversion, profited nothing by its falling in at last. His quarrels with
      my amiable sister&mdash;which took their rise from his interested
      charities toward me&mdash;ended in producing a separation. And, far from
      saving anything by Annabella&rsquo;s inheritance of her pin-money, he had a
      positive loss to put up with, in the shape of some hundreds extracted
      yearly from his income, as alimony to his uncongenial wife. He is said to
      make use of shocking language whenever my name is mentioned, and to wish
      that he had been carried off by the yellow fever before he ever set eyes
      on the Softly family.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father has retired from practice. He and my mother have gone to live in
      the country, near the mansion of the only marquis with whom my father was
      actually and personally acquainted in his professional days. The marquis
      asks him to dinner once a year, and leaves a card for my mother before he
      returns to town for the season. A portrait of Lady Malkinshaw hangs in the
      dining-room. In this way, my parents are ending their days contentedly. I
      can honestly say that I am glad to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Dulcifer, when I last heard of him, was editing a newspaper in
      America. Old File, who shared his flight, still shares his fortunes, being
      publisher of his newspaper. Young File resumed coining operations in
      London; and, having braved his fate a second time, threaded his way, in
      due course, up to the steps of the scaffold. Screw carries on the
      profitable trade of informer, in London. The dismal disappearance of Mill
      I have already recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much on the subject of my relatives and associates. On the subject of
      myself, I might still write on at considerable length. But while the
      libelous title of &ldquo;A ROGUE&rsquo;S LIFE&rdquo; stares me in the face at the top of the
      page, how can I, as a rich and reputable man, be expected to communicate
      any further autobiographical particulars, in this place, to a discerning
      public of readers? No, no, my friends! I am no longer interesting&mdash;I
      am only respectable like yourselves. It is time to say &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
